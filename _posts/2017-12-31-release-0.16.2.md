title: Release 0.16.2
---

Just a few weeks after our last release, we are releasing MDAnalysis version
0.16.2. The [release notes][notes] list the full details of the changes in this
version. This version fixes some bugs, but it mostly instroduces deprecation
warnings for changes that will occur in subsequent versions.

The first feature to be deprecated is the [`Timeseries` module][timeseries]
that will be removed in version 0.17.0. The
[`MDAnalysis.analysis.base.analysis_class`][analysis_class] function can be
used to replace the deprecated `Timeseries`.

Quick selectors are also deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0. You can
read the discussion in [issue 1377][issue_1377] to learn how to replace the
different selectors.

Finally, the global [flags][] will disappear in version 1.0 to be replaced with
more granular keyword arguments in the appropriate methods.

Removing outdated code allows us to keep MDAnalysis robust and consistent as we
prepare for 1.0 where the interface will become frozen. We are confident that
these features where not much used or have better replacement. Come to the
[mailing lists][lists] or our [github repository][github] to join the
conversation.

Thank you for all the contributors who reported issues or contributed code to
this version. Thank you also to [Dominik 'Rathann' Mierzejewski][rathmann] for
his first contribution to the code base.
