title: Release 0.16.2
---

Just a few weeks after our last release, we are releasing MDAnalysis version
0.16.2. The [release notes][notes] list the full details of the changes in this
version. This version fixes some bugs, but it mostly introduces deprecation
warnings for changes that will occur in subsequent versions.

The first feature to be deprecated is the [`Timeseries` module][timeseries]
that will be removed in version 0.17.0. The
[`MDAnalysis.analysis.base.analysis_class`][analysis_class] function can be
used to replace the deprecated `Timeseries`. `analysis_class` was introduced in version 0.16.0 and you can read more about it in a previous [blog post][post].

[Instant selectors][] are also deprecated and will be removed in release 1.0. These
shortcuts allow you to access segments, residues, or atoms using there names as
attribute. For instance, such selectors allow you to access a segment called
"SYSTEM" from a universe `u` by calling `u.SYSTEM`, or to select all the lysine
of a residue group `rg` by calling `rg.LYS`. Although these shortcuts used to be 
reasonably useful for interactive work, they also introduce
unexpected behaviours for a Python object, and are fragile mechanisms that are
difficult to maintain. You can read the discussion in [issue 1377][issue_1377]
to learn how to replace the different selectors.

Finally, the global [flags][] will disappear in release 1.0 to be replaced with
more granular keyword arguments in the appropriate methods. The flags introduce
a global state that could make MDAnalysis scripts run differently for different
users and could thus lead to difficult to reproduce results. The discussion
about removing the flags is happening in [issue 782][issue_782].

Removing outdated code allows us to keep MDAnalysis robust and consistent as we
prepare for 1.0 when the user interface will become frozen. We are confident that
these features were not much used or have better replacement. Come to the
[mailing lists][lists] or our [github repository][github] to join the
conversation.

Thank you to all the contributors who reported issues or contributed code to
this version. Thank you also to [Dominik 'Rathann' Mierzejewski][rathann] for
his first contribution to the code base.
