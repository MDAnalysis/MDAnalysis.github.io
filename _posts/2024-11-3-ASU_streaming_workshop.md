MDAnalysis, in conjunction with the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute][MolSSI]
(MolSSI) and with the support of the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative][CZI] and the
[Center for Biological Physics][CBP], is holding a **free, 2-day workshop** on **June
24th-25th** 2024 at **Arizona State University** in Tempe, Arizona, USA.

This two-day workshop is intended to transform attendees from users to
developers and will cover an introduction to MDAnalysis, software best
practices, and guide participants through the creation of their own [MDAKit][mdakits].

This workshop is suitable for students and researchers in the broad area
of computational (bio)chemistry, materials science and chemical engineering. It
is designed for those who have familiarity with MDAnalysis and are
comfortable working with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). For a better idea of things participants should be comfortable doing in Python or to freshen up on your skills, please have a look at the MolSSI lesson, "[Python Scripting for Computational Molecular Science](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/)". Workshop
participants should also already have a working [conda or mamba installation of
MDAnalysis](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/installation.html) (*mamba
preferred*), as well as an editor of their choice for editing files.


## Workshop Overview

MDAnalysis developers and experienced MolSSI instructors will teach
participants how to build their own MDAnalysis-based Python packages by guiding
them through the development of their own MDAKits. Specifically, the workshop
will include 3 modules: (1) an introduction to using and writing custom
analyses in MDAnalysis; (2) an overview of software development and maintenance
best practices; and (3) an interactive hackathon session where participants
write their own MDAKits.

The program will run from the morning of Monday, June 24th until the early
evening of Tuesday June 25th. Breakfast and lunch will be provided
together with tea/coffee during breaks.

Parts of the workshop will be held in a hybrid mode for those unable to attend
in-person. Registration for the hybrid components is required. Recordings of
hybrid sessions will be made available after the workshop.




## Registration

Attendance at this workshop will be *free* but the in-person part of the
workshop will be limited to 40 participants. The workshop will be delivered to
a small group to allow interactive discussions, questions, and participant
engagement.

A number of **bursaries** will be available to assist with travel and
accommodation costs for participants from outside the [greater Phoenix
area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_metropolitan_area). Bursaries (up
to *$600 in costs for US domestic travel*) and *up to 3 nights of hotel
accommodation* (single room within 5 minutes of the workshop venue) will be
awarded and you can apply for them as part of the registration process.

Register by **May 27, 2024** (midnight anywhere on Earth):

### *Bursaries* for in-person attendance

We especially welcome your application if you consider yourself being part of
an underrepresented demographic in the computational molecular sciences.

Bursaries are reserved to enable the attendance of participants from outside
the [greater Phoenix area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_metropolitan_area).

Note that airfare for travel awardees will have to be *booked by June 3 through
our travel agency*, so as an awardee you will have to be able to
respond to our communications (via email) immediately and act quickly.

Bursary recipients will be notified on May 29 or earlier. 


### Online participants

Part of the workshop will be taught in hybrid mode and if you are not able to
attend in person, please register for the online portion using the same
registration link above.
