title: "MDAnalysis Streaming Online Developer Workshop (Dec 4, 2024)"
---


MDAnalysis, in conjunction with [ASU][ASU] and with the support of a [CSSI Elements][CSSI] grant from the 
[National Science Foundation][NSF], is holding a **free, online developer workshop** focused on direct streaming and inline analysis of molecular simulations on **December 4th** 2024.


This online workshop is intended to transform attendees from users to
developers and will cover an introduction to MDAnalysis, software best
practices, and guide participants through the creation of their own [MDAKit][mdakits].

This workshop is suitable for students and researchers in the broad area
of computational (bio)chemistry, materials science and chemical engineering. It
is designed for those who have familiarity with MDAnalysis and are
comfortable working with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). For a better idea of things participants should be comfortable doing in Python or to freshen up on your skills, please have a look at the MolSSI lesson, "[Python Scripting for Computational Molecular Science](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/)". Workshop
participants should also already have a working [conda or mamba installation of
MDAnalysis](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/installation.html) (*mamba
preferred*), as well as an editor of their choice for editing files.


## Workshop Overview

MDAnalysis developers and experienced MolSSI instructors will teach
participants how to build their own MDAnalysis-based Python packages by guiding
them through the development of their own MDAKits. Specifically, the workshop
will include 3 modules: (1) an introduction to using and writing custom
analyses in MDAnalysis; (2) an overview of software development and maintenance
best practices; and (3) an interactive hackathon session where participants
write their own MDAKits.

The program will run from the morning of Monday, June 24th until the early
evening of Tuesday June 25th. Breakfast and lunch will be provided
together with tea/coffee during breaks.

Parts of the workshop will be held in a hybrid mode for those unable to attend
in-person. Registration for the hybrid components is required. Recordings of
hybrid sessions will be made available after the workshop.




## Registration

Attendance at this workshop will be *free*, and we encourage any
