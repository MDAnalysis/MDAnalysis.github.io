title: "MDAnalysis Streaming Online Developer Workshop (Dec 4, 2024)"
---


Have you ever wanted to analyse sub-picosecond dynamics in your trajectories? Trajectory file sizes too large? Want to sync up your analysis and trajectory production? Lucky for you MDAnalysis, in conjunction with [ASU][ASU] and with the support of a [CSSI Elements][CSSI] grant from the [National Science Foundation][NSF], is holding a **free, online developer workshop** focused on streaming and inline analysis of molecular simulations on **December 4th** 2024.


This online workshop is intended to introduce participants to streaming of trajectories directly from simulation engines, inline analysis 
of simulations and all the awesome science you can do with streaming. This workshop is suitable for students, developers and researchers in the broad area of computational (bio)chemistry, materials science and chemical engineering. It is designed for those who have some familiarity with MDAnalysis and are comfortable working with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and a molecular simulation engine such as [LAMMPS][LAMMPS], [GROMACS][GROMACS] or [NAMD][NAMD].



## Workshop Overview

MDAnalysis developers and ASU instructors will introduce streaming and contextualise it withing the MDAnalysis and the simulation community. ASU instructors will detail their approach for improved streaming interfaces, followed by demonstrations of streaming functionality (LAMMPS and NAMD) and the new streaming protocols developed at ASU. This will be followed by a live-coding exercise in which participants will impement their own streaming analysis, followed by a developer forum. See the [Full Schedule](XXXX) below for more details.

The program will run from around midday of Wed 4th Dec until the afternoon Pacific time.




## Registration

Attendance at this workshop will be *free*, and we encourage anyone with an interest in attending to register below.
