title: "MDAnalysis Streaming Online Developer Workshop (Dec 4, 2024)"
---


Have you ever wanted to analyse sub-picosecond dynamics in your trajectories? Trajectory file sizes too large? Want to sync up your analysis and trajectory production? Lucky for you MDAnalysis, in conjunction with [ASU][ASU] and with the support of a [CSSI Elements][CSSI] grant from the [National Science Foundation][NSF], is holding a **free, online developer workshop** focused on direct streaming and inline analysis of molecular simulations on **December 4th** 2024.


This online workshop is intended to introduce participants to streaming of trajectories directly from simulation engines, inline analysis 
of simulations and the kinds of awesome science you can do with streaming. This workshop is suitable for students, developers and researchers in the broad area of computational (bio)chemistry, materials science and chemical engineering. It is designed for those who have some familiarity with MDAnalysis and are comfortable working with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and a molecular simulation engine such as [LAMMPS][LAMMPS], [GROMACS][GROMACS] or [NAMD][NAMD].



## Workshop Overview

MDAnalysis developers and ASU instructors will teach
participants how to build their own MDAnalysis-based Python packages by guiding
them through the development of their own MDAKits. Specifically, the workshop
will include 3 modules: (1) an introduction to using and writing custom
analyses in MDAnalysis; (2) an overview of software development and maintenance
best practices; and (3) an interactive hackathon session where participants
write their own MDAKits.

The program will run from around midday of Wed 4th Dec until the afternoon.
