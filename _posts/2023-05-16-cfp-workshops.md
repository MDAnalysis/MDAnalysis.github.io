title: Call for Workshop Partners
---

Is your organization interested in expanding its teaching and outreach activities? Are you looking to reach a wider audience or demonstrate how your organizationâ€™s software/tools fit into a larger research workflow? MDAnalysis is seeking partnerships with organizations to join forces and offer online teaching workshops for complementary skills between Summer 2023 and Winter 2024. 

## Workshop Themes and Format
We welcome remote workshop ideas focusing on a variety of topics around the use of MDAnalysis and complementary packages. Proposed workshops may range from 1-2 hour webinars (for general introductory workshops) to half- or full-day online workshops diving into specific areas of interest. For inspiration, check out our BioExcel webinar ([MDAnalysis: Interoperable analysis of Python biomolecular simulations in Python][bioexcel]), PRACE/SURF course, ([Using MDAnalysis for Efficient Simulation Pre- and Post-Processing][prace]), and our CCPBioSim/CCP5 workshops ([MDAnalysis and Machine Learning for Molecular Simulations][ccp]) offered at the [University of Edinburgh][edinburgh] and [Durham University][durham].

## How and When to Contact Us
Please indicate your interest to partner with us or suggest a workshop, or even just to set up a time to discuss further,  through our [Google form][google]. The MDAnalysis team will review forms as they are received and follow-up with you as soon as possible. If you have a rough idea of when you would like to offer a workshop, please reach out to us by the following deadlines:
