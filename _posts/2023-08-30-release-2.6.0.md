title: Release 2.6.0 and 2.6.1 of MDAnalysis
---

We are happy to release version 2.6.1 of MDAnalysis!
(This blog post describes 2.6.1 and the initial release in the 2.6 series, 2.6.0.)

This is a minor update to the MDAnalysis library.

This release of MDAnalysis is packaged under a [GPLv3+ license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
Additionally all contributions made from commit [44733fc](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/commit/44733fc214dcfdcc2b7cb3e3705258781bb491bd)
onwards are made under the [LGPLv2.1+ license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html). More details about these license changes
will be provided in an upcoming blog post.

In line with [NEP 29][], the minimum required NumPy version has
been raised to 1.22.3.

Supported Python versions: **3.9, 3.10, 3.11**

Supported Operating Systems:
  - **Linux** (on [x86-64][], [aarch64][])
    - *Note: aarch64 can only be installed via pip for now*
  - **Windows** (on [x86-64][])
  - **MacOS** (on [x86-64][] and [ARM64][])


## Upgrading to MDAnalysis version 2.6.1

To update with `conda` from the [conda-forge channel][] run

```bash
conda update -c conda-forge mdanalysis
```

To update from [PyPi][] with `pip` run

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis
```

For more help with installation see the [installation instructions in the User Guide][]. Make sure you are using a Python version compatible with MDAnalysis before upgrading (Python >= 3.9).


## Notable changes

For a full list of changes, bugfixes and deprecations see the [CHANGELOG][].


#### Fixes:
 - Fix to element guessing code to more accurately interpret atom names split by
   numbers (i.e. N0A is now recognised as N rather than NA) [Issue #4167, PR #4168]
 - The -ffast-math compiler flag is no longer used by default at build time,
   avoiding inconsistent (although still scientifically correct) results seen
   in Intel MacOS systems when calling `AtomGroup.center_of_charge(..., unwrap=True).
   This also avoids potentially [incorrect floating point results][]. (PR #4220)
 - DATAWriter, CRD, PQR, and PDBQT files can now be correctly written to
   compressed files. Before this change, any attempt to write to a compressed
   format (gzip or bzip2) would lead to writing out an uncompressed file. (PR #4163)
 - Prevent accidental merging of bond/angle/dihedral types when they are
   defined as LAMMPS style string integers instead of tuples. This was leading
   to an incorrect number of bond/angle/dihedral types being written to lammps
   data files. (PR #4003)

#### Enhancements:
 - An `exclude_same` argument has been added to `InterRDF` allowing pairs of
   atoms that share the same residue, segment or chain to be excluded from the
   calculation. (PR #4161)
 - LAMMPS reader now supports the `continuous` ChainReader option. (PR #4170)
 - AtomGroup representation now returns atom indices in the same order
   as they are stored in the AtomGroup. (PR #4191)

#### Changes:
 - As per NEP29, the minimum supported runtime version of NumPy has
   been increased to 1.22.3. (PR #4160)
 - The GSD package is now an optional dependency. (PR #4174)
 - The MDAnalysis package now only supports GSD versions 3.0.1 or
   above. (PR #4153)
 - MDAnalysis no longer officially supports 32 bit installations,
   (they are no longer tested in our continuous integration pipelines).
   Note: no code changes have been made to disable 32 bit, although it
   is known that new versions of most MDAnalysis core dependencies no longer
   release 32 bit compatible versions. (PR #4176)
 - The package license has been updated to [GPLv3+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)
   to better reflect the compatibility of GPLv2+ with Apache and GPLv3 licensed
   codes. Additionally all new contributions from commit [44733fc](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/commit/44733fc214dcfdcc2b7cb3e3705258781bb491bd)
   onwards are made under the [LGPLv2.1+ license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html). (PR #4219)

#### Deprecations:
 - The misspelt `Boltzman_constant` entry in `MDAnalysis.units` is now
   deprecated in favour the correctly spelt `Boltzmann_constant`. (PRs #4230 and #4214)
 - `MDAnalysis.analysis.hole2` is now deprecated in favour of a new
   [HOLE2 MDAKit](https://www.mdanalysis.org/hole2-mdakit/). (PR #4200)
