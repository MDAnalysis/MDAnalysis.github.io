MDAnalysis has been accepted as an [organization][org] into [Google
Summer of Code 2022][gsoc]!  If you are interested in working with us
this summer and you are new to open source, please read the advice and
links below and write to us on the [mailing list].

We are looking forward to all applications. Note that the GSoC program was
[updated](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/11/expanding-google-summer-of-code-in-2022.html)
compared to previous years: GSoC will welcome not just students, but *any new
and beginner open source contributors over 18 years old*. Projects are also now
scoped as either 175-hour (medium) or 350-hour (long) size. Finally, the duration
can be extended from the standard 12 weeks to 22 weeks.

The application window **deadline** is **April 19, 2022 18:00 (UTC)**. As
part of the application process you must familiarize yourself with [Google
Summer of Code 2022][gsoc]. 

If you are interested in working with us please read on and contact us
on our [mailing list].  Apply at as soon as possible at
https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com; the application window opens on
April 4, 2022 but potential GSoC Contributors are expected to
familiarize themselves with application requirements and mentoring
organizations as soon as possible. It's also never too early to
discuss application ideas with us!

# Project Ideas

If you have your own idea about a potential project we'd love to work with you
to develop this idea; please write to us on the [developer list][mailing list]
to discuss it there.

We also have listed several [possible projects][ideas] for you to work on. Our
initial list of ideas (see summaries in the table below) contains various
projects of different scope and with different skill requirements. However,
check the [ideas][] page — we might add more ideas after the posting date of
this post.

You don't need to have all the skills that we are listing, although that helps,
of course. But you need to demonstrate to us that you're able and keen to learn
anything that you don't know yet, and we will be happy to help you learn during
your project with us.

# Information for potential GSoC Contributors

You must meet our [own requirements] if you want to be a GSoC
Contributor with MDAnalysis this year (read all the docs behind these
links!). You must also meet the [eligibility criteria]. Our [GSoC
FAQ][] collects common questions from applicants.

The MDAnalysis community values diversity and is committed to
providing a productive, harassment-free to every member. Our [Code of
Conduct] explains the values that we as a community uphold. *Every
member (and every GSoC Contributor) agrees to follow the [Code of
Conduct]*.

As a start to get familiar with MDAnalysis and open source development you
should follow these steps:

## Complete the Quick Start Guide

We have a [Quick Start Guide] explaining the basics of MDAnalysis. You
should go through it at least once to understand how MDAnalysis is
used. Continue reading the [User Guide] to learn more.

## Introduce yourself to us

Introduce yourself on the [mailing list]. Tell us what you plan to work
on during the summer or what you have already done with MDAnalysis.

## Close an issue of MDAnalysis

You must have *at least one commit in the development branch of MDAnalysis* in
order to be eligible, i.e., you must demonstrate that you have been seriously
engaged with the MDAnalysis project.  We have a list of [easy bugs][] and
suggested [GSOC Starter issues][GSOC Starter] to work on in our issue tracker
on GitHub. *We only accept one [GSOC Starter issue][GSOC Starter] per
applicant* so that everybody gets a chance. If you want to dive deeper, tackle
some of the other issues.

We also appreciate if you write more tests or update/improve our documentation.

We recommend you start your application by working on an issue. It will give
you a better understanding of MDAnalysis as a project and improve the quality
of your application.

To start developing for MDAnalysis have a look at our
guide on [contributing to MDAnalysis][dev-guide] and write to us on
the [mailing list][] if you have more questions about setting up a
development environment or how to contribute.
