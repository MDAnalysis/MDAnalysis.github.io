MDAnalysis is excited to be kicking off a series of free online training workshops in Fall 2023. The first will be held on **October 25, 2023 from 15:00-18:30 UTC**.

This online workshop will consist of an introduction to the [MDAnalysis Python library][MDAnalysis], as well as an opportunity for hands-on learning through basic MDAnalysis tutorials. The workshop will be delivered to a small group to allow interactive discussions, questions, and participant engagement. It is designed for *beginners to MDAnalysis* who already have a *working knowledge of Python* and *know how use shell and notebook environments*.

## Register soon (places limited)
If you are interested in participating in this workshop, fill out [this short application][eventbrite] form before **September 30, 2023**. Selected participants will be notified in early October. 

*We have a small number of bursaries to enable participation for researchers from underrepresented groups who are facing financial barriers*; these can be applied for when completing the application form.

We are looking into organizing the next workshop for Australasian time zones, so also keep an eye out for announcements of future workshops!
