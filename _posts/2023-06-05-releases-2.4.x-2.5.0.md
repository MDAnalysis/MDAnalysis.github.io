title: Releases 2.5.0 and 2.4.x of MDAnalysis
---

We are happy to release the version 2.5.0 of MDAnalysis!

This is a minor update to the MDAnalysis library.

In line with [NEP 29][], the minimum required Python and NumPy versions have
been raised 3.9 and 1.21.0 respectively.

Supported Python versions: **3.9, 3.10, 3.11**

Supported Operating Systems:
  - **Linux** (on [x86-64][], [aarch64][] *note: aarch64 and ppc64le can only be installed via pip for now*)
  - **Windows** (on [x86-64][])
  - **MacOS** (on [x86-64][] and [Apple M1][])

*Note: this release also adds wheels for [aarch64][] and [Apple M1][] architectures for pip installations.*

## Upgrading to MDAnalysis version 2.5.0

To update with `conda` from the [conda-forge channel][] run

```bash
conda update -c conda-forge mdanalysis
```

To update from [PyPi][] with `pip` run

```bash
pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis
```

For more help with installation see the [installation instructions in the User Guide][].


## Notable changes

For a full list of changes, bugfixes and deprecations see the [CHANGELOG][].

### Fixes:
 - Fixed an issue where transformations were not being properly applied to
   Universes with multiple trajectories (i.e. using the ChainReader)
   (Issue #3657 #4008 PR #3906)
 - Fixed an issue with the the `heavy` distance_type for `WaterBridgeAnalysis`
   where distance was not correctly assigned when more than one hydrogen
   was bonded to a heavy atom (Issue #4040, PR #4066).
 - PDB topology parser no longer fails when encountering unknown formal
   charges and instead simply does not populate attribute (Issue #4027)
 - Fixed an issue where using the `between` keyword of `HydrogenBondAnalysis` 
   led to incorrect donor-atom distances being returned (PR #4092, Issue #4091)
 - Fixed an issue where chi1_selections() ignored atom names CG1 OG OG1 SG
   and incorrectly returned `None` for amino acids CYS, ILE, SER, THR, VAL
   (Issue #4108, PR #4109)
 - Fix H5MD reader to read box vectors rather than returning `None` as the
   dimensions (Issue #4075, PR #4076)
 - Fix to allow reading NetCDF trajectories which do not have the `time`
   variable defined (Issue #4073, PR #4074)
 - Allows shape_parameter and asphericity to yield per residue quantities
   (Issue #3002, PR #3905)
 - Fix EDRReader failing when parsing single-frame EDR files (Issue #3999)
 - Add 'PairIJ Coeffs' to the list of sections in LAMMPSParser.py
   (Issue #3336)
 - PDBReader now defaults atom values for ts.data['occupancy'] to 0.0, rather
   than the previous default of 1.0. This now matches the default used when
   setting Universe Topology attributes using the first frame's information (PR #3988)

### Enhancements:
 - ARM64 (osx and linux) wheels are now provided via PyPi (Issue #4054)
 - Addition of a new analysis class `analysis.atomicdistances.AtomicDistances`
   to provide distances between two atom groups over a trajectory.
   (Issue #3654, PR #4105)
 - Add kwarg `n_frames` to class method `empty()` in
   `MDAnalysis.core.universe`, enabling creation of a blank `Universe` with
   multiple frames (PR #4140)
 - PDBReader now populates ts.data['tempfactor'] with the tempfactor for
   each atom *for each frame*. If an entry is missing for a given atom,
   this will default to a `1.0` value. Note, this does not affect the
   topology, i.e. `AtomGroup.tempfactors` is not dynamically updated.
   (Issue #3825, PR #3988)
 - Add writing u.trajectory.ts.data['molecule_tag'] as molecule tags to
   LAMMPS data file (Issue #3548)
 - Add `progressbar_kwargs` parameter to `AnalysisBase.run` method, allowing
   to modify description, position etc of tqdm progressbars. (PR #4085)
 - Add a nojump transformation, which unwraps trajectories so that particle
   paths are continuous. (Issue #3703, PR #4031)
 - Added AtomGroup TopologyAttr to calculate gyration moments (Issue #3904,
   PR #3905)
 - Add support for TPR files produced by Gromacs 2023 (Issue #4047)
 - Add distopia distance calculation library bindings as a selectable backend
   for `calc_bonds` in `MDA.lib.distances`. (Issue #3783, PR #3914)
 - AuxReaders are now pickle-able and copy-able (Issue #1785, PR #3887)
 - Add pickling support for Atom, Residue, Segment, ResidueGroup 
   and SegmentGroup. (PR #3953)

### Changes:
 - As per NEP29 the minimum supported Python version has been raised to 3.9
   and NumPy has been raised to 1.21 (note: in practice later versions of NumPy
   may be required depending on  your architecture, operating system, or Python
   version) (PRs #4115 and #3983).
 - Add progress bars to track the progress of `mds.EinsteinMSD` `_conclude()`
   methods (`_conclude_simple()` and `_conclude_fft()`) (Issue #4070, PR #4072)
 - The deprecated direct indexing and `times` from the `results` attribute of
   analysis.nucleicacids' NucPairDist and WatsonCrickDist classes has been
    removed. Please use the `results.pair_distances` and `times` attributes
    instead (Issue #3744)
 - RDKitConverter changes (part of Issue #3996):
   - moved some variables (`MONATOMIC_CATION_CHARGES `and
     `STANDARDIZATION_REACTIONS`) out of the related functions to allow users
     fine tuning them if necessary.
   - changed the sorting of heavy atoms when inferring bond orders and
     charges: previously only based on the number of unpaired electrons, now
     based on this and the number of heavy atom neighbors.
   - use RDKit's `RunReactantInPlace` for the standardization reactions, which
     should result in a significant speed improvement as we don't need to use
     bespoke code to transfer atomic properties from the non-standardized mol
     to the standardized one.
