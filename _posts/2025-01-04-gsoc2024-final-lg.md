As we enter the new year, we at MDAnalysis are still reflecting on and grateful for the work of our contributors in 2024. Namely, we would like to recognize the completion of [Luna Morrow's](@lunamorrow) [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) project with MDAnalysis, [Extend MDAnalysis Interoperability with OpenBabel](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2024/projects/yLzX6MjS) — read more about this incredibly useful enhancement of MDAnalysis's interoperability with other packages in the field in [Luna's blog post][blog-luna].

We have enjoyed watching Luna navigate the full cycle of planning, designing, implementing, testing, and documenting a software solution and look forward to seeing what she accomplishes next!

We also thank [Google](https://opensource.google/) for supporting this project and continuing to support MDAnalysis as a GSoC organization since 2016.

### Looking ahead to GSoC 2025

While the MDAnalysis community remains enthusiastic about continuing to participate in the [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program, [Google](https://opensource.google/) has not yet announced a GSoC 2025 program. Given that there is an application process for organizations — such as MDAnalysis — to participate, there is no guarantee that MDAnalysis will be selected by Google as a participating GSoC organization. Once we know more, we will share updates on our [`#gsoc`](https://discord.com/channels/807348386012987462/807350567893860433) Discord (join using [this invite link](https://discord.com/invite/fXTSfDJyxE)) and [`#GSoC Discussions`](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/discussions/categories/gsoc-discussions) GitHub Discussions channels.

In the meantime, we welcome you to start [learning MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/learning_MDAnalysis/) and familiarizing yourself with the project through our [introductory videos](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/learning_MDAnalysis/#introductory). To dive into the code base, check out the [MDAnalysis User Guide](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/index.html); we suggest starting by [installing the MDAnalysis package](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/installation.html) and working through the [Quick Start Guide](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/examples/quickstart.html). Once you are a bit familiar with the MDAnalysis package, you can look at the User Guide sections explaining [how to contribute](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/contributing.html).

Please note that in addition to code contributions, we highly value [participating in the MDAnalysis community](https://www.mdanalysis.org/#participating) in other ways, including submitting [general feedback](https://www.mdanalysis.org/about/#feedback) and [issues via the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues) and/or engaging in discussions on the MDAnalysis [Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/807348386012987462/) (join using [this invite link](https://discord.com/invite/fXTSfDJyxE)) and [GitHub Discussions forum](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/discussions).
