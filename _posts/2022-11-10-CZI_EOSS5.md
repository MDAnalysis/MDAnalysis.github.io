title: MDAnalysis CZI EOSS 5 Grant: Outreach and Project Manager
---

We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis has been awarded a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative as part of the [Essential Open Source Software for Science][] program: [“EOSS5: Growing the MDAnalysis community sustainably: A dedicated project manager, teaching and outreach initiatives”][eoss project link]. 

The MDAnalysis organisation strongly believes that engaging in outreach, mentoring and teaching is key to its mission of being the leading software package for molecular simulation analysis in Python.

This 2-year grant will enable us to hire a full-time community, outreach, and project manager to extend our teaching and mentoring commitments and engage with the molecular simulation community across academia and industry.

Over the next two years, our key deliverables include:
- Increasing our participation in outreach activities
- Organising user group meetings (UGMs)
- Hosting a series of online teaching workshops (3 per year)
- Networking with other software projects within and outside the molecular simulation space
- Engaging with industrial partners towards opening additional funding streams for the project  

A big thank you to all contributors, past and present, for making this possible.
