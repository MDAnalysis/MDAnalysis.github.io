---

## Overview

MDAnalysis is beginning to gear up for our 3.0 release! Following discussions at our first [UGM][], we (the MDAnalysis [Core Developers][]) have decided on priorities for our this big milestone. Our primary goals can be divided into several main themes.


### A trimmed down core library

As we move into the next generation of molecular simulation, we are looking to provide a highly functional, easily maintanable package that can be the foundation of a wide variety of 

Following the sucessful introduction of the MDAKit ecosystem, which provides infrastructure for creating FAIR packages that address specific scientific questions in the analysis of molecular simulation, we are aiming to move some more specialized analyses currently present in the MDAnalysis core library to MDAKits. Several analyses modules, including encore, path-similarity, helanal and waterdynamics are being assessed to undergo this transition. Indeed some of these packages are already deployed as MDAKits. 

This change will allow 


### User facing API changes 



### Refactoring low level APIs 





### Improving and formalising roles and responsibilities.
