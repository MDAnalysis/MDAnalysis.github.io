As the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) program has now come to a close, we would like to highlight the work of our two outstanding GSoC contributors, [Egor Marin](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/cOTjpLid) (@marinegor) and [Xu Hong Chen](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/4vt9npUg) (@xhgchen), who successfully completed their [GSoC projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/mdanalysis) with MDAnalysis. You can read more about their projects in their blog posts:

* Egor: [GSoC 2023 - Implementation of parallel analysis in MDAnalysis][blog-egor]
* Xu Hong: [GSoC 2023 - Add calculations for self-diffusivity and viscosity][blog-xuhong]

We have tremendously enjoyed working with Egor and Xu Hong and wish them the best in their future contributions to the MDAnalysis community and beyond!

We also thank [Google](https://opensource.google/) for supporting the students and continuing to support MDAnalysis as a GSoC organization since 2016. As Google has announced that the upcoming 2024 program represents the [20-year anniversary of GSoC](https://opensource.googleblog.com/), the MDAnalysis team is hard at work planning for its application to be a mentoring organization.

## Interested in becoming an MDAnalysis mentor for GSoC?
Do you have experience using and contributing to MDAnalysis? Are you passionate about introducing new contributors to open source software? If so, we would love to have you join our volunteer team of mentors!

Visit the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) to familiarize yourself with the program. You can also check out Google's ['Being a Great GSoC Mentor' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J_eBuYxcyg) and [mentor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) to learn more about what is involved in mentoring for GSoC. MDAnalysis has also adapted this material into an [Onboarding Guide for Mentors](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/Onboarding-Guide-2023#for-mentors), which includes additional details on expectations tips about mentorship.

If you are interested and would like to chat with us further about becoming an MDAnalysis mentor for GSoC, please get ahold of us on [Discord][] or our [GitHub Discussions][] forum. 

*While we intend to apply for the GSoC 2024 program, please note that we can not guarantee that MDAnalysis will be selected by Google as a mentoring organization.*
