MDAnalysis is excited to be kicking off a series of free online training workshops in Fall 2023. The first will be held on **October 25, 2023 from 15:00-18:30 UTC**. The next workshop will be organized for Australasian time zones and will be announced shortly.

This remote workshop will consist of an introduction to the MDAnalysis Python library, as well as an opportunity for hands-on learning through basic MDAnalysis tutorials. The workshop will be delivered to a small group to allow interactive discussions, questions, and participant engagement. It is designed for beginners to MDAnalysis who already have a working knowledge of Python and working with shell and notebook environments.
