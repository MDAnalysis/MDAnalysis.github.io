title: Online Workshop: Introduction to MDAnalysis and Molecular Nodes
---

After a successful [launch of our online training workshop series](https://www.mdanalysis.org/2024/01/15/mda_events/#mdanalysis-online-training-workshops) in October 2023, MDAnalysis is happy to announce that the next scheduled workshop will take place **February 28, 2024 from 03:00-07:00 UTC** to accommodate folks based in Australasian time zones. 

For this remote workshop we are collaborating with @bradyajohnston, creator of [Molecular Nodes](https://bradyajohnston.github.io/MolecularNodes/). Molecular Nodes is an add-on for the 3D modeling & animation program [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Molecular Nodes enables easy import of molecular dynamics trajectories and topologies from a variety of simulation sources. Molecular Nodes provides the translation layer that allows importing of molecular data formats, while Blender provides the industry-leading animation and rendering tools to create visually stunning molecular graphics with ease.

The program will consist of an introduction to the MDAnalysis Python library and hands-on basic MDAnalysis tutorials, followed by an introduction to Molecular Nodes and an interactive tutorial for visualizing imported MDAnalysis data. The workshop will be delivered to a small group to allow interactive discussions, questions, and participant engagement. This workshop is free and suitable for researchers in the broad area of computational (bio)chemistry, materials science and chemical engineering. It is designed for those who are beginners to MDAnalysis and Molecular Nodes, but already have previous knowledge of Python and working with shell and notebook environments.
