title: MDAnalysis Junior Developer
---

Thanks to the support of a NumFOCUS Small Developer Grant, MDAnalysis is looking to hire a junior developer for 150h (1 month FTE) at 24 USD/hour (3600 USD) to improve the content and organisation of our teaching materials.

MDAnalysis regularly holds workshops to teach researchers how to use our package for their work. We are looking for a junior developer to help us tidy and repackage our teaching materials to provide a cleaner, easier to navigate resource for both users and future workshop creators. 
Past workshop materials can be found in the following repos:

- [CCP5 Summer School Workshop](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/MDAnalysis_ML_workshop)
- [2022 Edinburgh workshop](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/MDAnalysis_ML_workshop)
- [2021 PRACE Workshop](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/MDAnalysis_ML_workshop)
- [2018 Workshop/Hackathon](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopHackathon2018)

Example tasks will include:
- Identifying any outdated material and standardizing contents
- Implementing continuous integration solutions (e.g. [nbval](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopHackathon2018)) to automatically check and notify if notebook code breaks in the future
- Investigating and implementing new modern notebook [extensions](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopHackathon2018) to improve the teaching/learning experience
- Identifying any areas where teaching materials are lacking, propose and implement corresponding changes
- Migrating presentation slides to a common, interactive format (e.g., [RISE](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopHackathon2018))
- Compiling frequently asked questions in the mailing list in the [FAQ](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/faq.html) page 
- Replacing the current outdated MDAnalysis [Tutorials](https://www.mdanalysis.org/MDAnalysisTutorial/) page with an overview of all available tutorials, documented and organized by topic/experience level
- Advertising the improvements to the documentation to the MDAcommunity with blog entries and social media posts

You will have the flexibility to decide how to allocate the contract hours, either part-time or full-time, with the commitment to conclude the project by June 2023.
