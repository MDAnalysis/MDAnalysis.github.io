title: SolvationAnalysis Published in JOSS
---

We're happy to announce that the [SolvationAnalysis][solvation] Python package is now [published][paper] in the [Journal of Open Source Software][joss] (JOSS):

Orion Archer Cohen, Hugo Macdermott-Opeskin, Lauren Lee, Tingzheng Hou, Kara D. Fong, Ryan Kingsbury, Jingyang Wang, and Kristin A. Persson, (2023). *SolvationAnalysis: A Python toolkit for understanding liquid solvation structure in classical molecular dynamics simulations.* **Journal of Open Source Software**, 8(84), 5183, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05183


Originally developed by @orionarcher as a [GSoC 2021 project][gsocblog], SolvationAnalysis builds on [MDAnalysis] and [pandas] to make analyzing solvation structure much, much easier. With a few lines of code, you can extract key solvation properties from any molecular dynamics simulation. With a few more, you can visualize solvation trends within and between different solutions. Further, *SolvationAnalysis* is designed with extensibility in mind, exposing a core representation of solvation that users can use for brand new analyses. To get started with using *SolvationAnalysis* in your workflow, check out the [documentation and tutorials][docs].
