title: SolvationAnalysis Published in JOSS
---

We're happy to announce that the Python package, [`SolvationAnalysis`][solvation], is now [published][paper] in the [Journal of Open Source Software][joss] (JOSS). Originally developed by @orioncohen as a [GSoC 2021 project][gsocblog], `SolvationAnalysis` builds on `MDAnalysis` and `pandas` to automate extraction of solvation information from molecular dynamic simulations in order to compute key solvation properties. To get started with using `SolvationAnalysis` in your workflow, check out the documentation and tutorials on [readthedocs][docs].
