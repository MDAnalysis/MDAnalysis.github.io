MDAnalysis aims to establish clear communication channels to effectively disseminate information, engage the community, and encourage participation. 
For this [Outreachy project](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-june-2024-internship-round/communities/mdanalysis/), Adetutu Oluwasanmi will develop a social media and communications strategy for MDAnalysis to grow its user and contributor base. 

Adetutu will conduct surveys to understand the communication preferences of MDAnalysis developers and users. Based on the survey data, she will recommend the best platforms for discussions and increasing engagement. 
Additionally, she will set up an email newsletter to keep the community updated on MDAnalysis news, announcements, and events.

Adetutu Oluwasanmi is a First-Class Microbiology graduate from Lagos State University. She recently completed a 1-year diploma in software engineering at AltSchool Africa, where she gained coding and software development skills.
Her previous roles include social media manager, communications intern, and freelance science writer, giving her a diverse skill set that she brings to her current project. 

She is contributing to the MDAnalysis project through Outreachy, a program that supports diversity in tech by providing internships to underrepresented groups.
