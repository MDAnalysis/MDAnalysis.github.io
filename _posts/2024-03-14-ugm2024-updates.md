---

There are exciting updates to announce regarding the [2024 MDAnalysis UGM](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2024/) (User Group Meeting), taking place August 21-23, 2024 in London, UK. Keep reading to learn more about the exciting talks you can expect from experts in the molecular dynamics simulations space, and a deadline extension to make sure you have time to submit your own abstract for giving a talk or presenting a poster during the UGM.

# Keynote Speakers
We are proud to introduce two fantastic keynote speakers for the UGM: Dr. Antonia Mey and Dr. Francesca Stanzione! Read more about them and their work below.

title="Dr. Antonia Mey" alt="Dr. Antonia Mey, Chancellor's Fellow, University of Edinburgh School of Chemistry. Antonia has worked on Markov State models with Frank Noe and alchemical free energy calculations with Julien Michel before starting her own research group in 2020. Her group works on computational biophysics problems using machine learning and simulations to understand protein function. She is an advocate for open-source software and diamond open access publishing models. She has contributed to pyEmma, BioSimSpace and she and her group (https://mey-research.org) are avid users of MDAnalysis."

title="Dr. Francesca Stanzione" alt="Dr. Francesca Stanzione, Senior Scientist, Sosei Heptares. Francesca is a computational chemist with over a decade expertise in target assessment, hit identification and lead optimisation. After obtaining a Ph.D. in Biotechnology, Francesca embarked on a distinguished career path. With five years of postdoctoral fellowships Francesca’s work centered on characterising the structural and dynamical properties of complex biological systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes, biological membranes and biomaterials. In 2023, Francesca joined Sosei Heptares, a renowned player in the pharmaceutical industry, where she now provides invaluable computational support to a variety of drug discovery campaigns. Prior to her role at Sosei Heptares, Francesca was at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC), working closely with software developers to help the development and enhancement of computational tools for drug discovery."
