title: Molecular visualization in the Jupyter Notebook with nglview
---

[**nglview**](https://github.com/arose/nglview) is a Python package that makes it
easy to visualize molecular systems, including trajectories, directly in
the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). The [recent 0.4.0
release](https://twitter.com/asrmoin/status/701677261980700672) of nglview
brings a convenient interface for visualizing MDAnalysis `Universe` and
`AtomGroup` objects directly.

```python
import MDAnalysis as mda
import nglview as nv
from nglview.datafiles import PDB, XTC

u = mda.Universe(PDB, XTC)

protein = u.select_atoms('protein')
```

Although we could use the full `Universe`, selecting a subset of the atoms as
an `AtomGroup` will give better performance when viewing the trajectory
interactively. We can feed this directly to the `nglview.show_mdanalysis`
function to produce the Jupyter widget:

```python
w = nv.show_mdanalysis(protein)
w
```

This will give something like this in the notebook itself:

<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>

	<script src="../../../../js/build/ngl.embedded.min.js"></script>

	<script>

		if( !Detector.webgl ) Detector.addGetWebGLMessage();

		NGL.mainScriptFilePath = "../../../../js/build/ngl.embedded.min.js";

		function onInit(){
			var stage = new NGL.Stage( "viewport" );
			stage.loadFile( "../../../../data/md_1u19.pdb", { defaultRepresentation: true } );
            stage.setTheme( "light" )
		}

		document.addEventListener( "DOMContentLoaded", function() {
			NGL.init( onInit );
		} );

	</script>

	<div id="viewport" style="width:700px; height:400px;"></div>

</body>
</html>

The notebook widget (you'll have to try it yourself to see!) also lets you select atoms by
clicking on the molecule, [add custom representations](http://arose.github.io/ngl/doc/#User_manual/Usage/Molecular_representations)
to [atom selections](http://arose.github.io/ngl/doc/#User_manual/Usage/Selection_language),
and interactively view different frames of the trajectory, both programmatically and with
a graphical slider. Be sure to double-click the notebook viewer widget to have a look
at everything in a lovely full-screen view, too!

**nglview** is just a `pip install` away:

    pip install nglview

Give it a try, and be sure to thank [Alexander Rose](https://github.com/arose)
and [Hai Nguyen](https://github.com/hainm) for pushing this project forward!
