title: Molecular visualization in the Jupyter Notebook with nglview
---

**[nglview](https://github.com/arose/nglview)** is a Python package that makes it
easy to visualize molecular systems, including trajectories, directly in
the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). The [recent 0.4.0
release](https://twitter.com/asrmoin/status/701677261980700672) of nglview
brings a convenient interface for visualizing MDAnalysis `Universe` and
`AtomGroup` objects directly:

```python
import MDAnalysis as mda
import nglview as nv
from nglview.datafiles import PDB, XTC

u = mda.Universe(PDB, XTC)

protein = u.select_atoms('protein')
```

Although we could use the full `Universe`, selecting a subset of the atoms as
an `AtomGroup` will give better performance when viewing the trajectory
interactively. We can feed this directly to the `nglview.show_mdanalysis`
function to produce the Jupyter widget:

```python
w = nv.show_mdanalysis(protein)
w
```

This will give something like this in the notebook itself:

<script src="{{site.js}}/build/ngl.embedded.min.js">
</script>

<script>

  if( !Detector.webgl ) Detector.addGetWebGLMessage();

  NGL.mainScriptFilePath = "{{site.js}}/build/ngl.embedded.min.js";

  function onInit(){
	  var stage = new NGL.Stage( "viewport" );
	  stage.loadFile( "{{site.data_files}}/md_1u19.pdb", { defaultRepresentation: true } );
	  stage.setTheme( "light" )
  
      window.addEventListener( "resize", function( event ){
         stage.handleResize();
      }, false );
      
      stage.viewer.container.addEventListener( "dblclick", function(){
         stage.toggleFullscreen();
      } );
  }

  document.addEventListener( "DOMContentLoaded", function() {
	  NGL.init( onInit );
  } );

</script>

<div id="viewport" style="max-width:100%; height:400px;"></div>

The notebook widget (you'll have to try it yourself to see â€” what you
see above is a limited view but you can still rotate and zoom the molecule) also lets you select atoms by
clicking on the molecule, [add custom representations](http://arose.github.io/ngl/doc/#User_manual/Usage/Molecular_representations)
to [atom selections](http://arose.github.io/ngl/doc/#User_manual/Usage/Selection_language),
and interactively view different frames of the trajectory, both programmatically and with
a graphical slider. Be sure to *double-click the notebook viewer widget* to have a look
at everything in a lovely *full-screen view*, too!

**nglview** is just a `pip install` away:

    pip install nglview

Give it a try, and be sure to thank
