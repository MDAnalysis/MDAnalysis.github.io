We are excited to announce that [registration][eventbrite] is now open for MDAnalysis’s inaugural user group meeting (UGM)! The meeting will be held in-person on September 27-29, 2023 in the [Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon][uniL] Auditorium in Building C6 (Building C6, Faculdade de Ciências da, Universidade de Lisboa, Campo Grande, 1749-016 Lisboa).

The UGM will bring together users of the MDAnalysis package from different communities. Our goal is to foster an opportunity for interdisciplinary researchers and developers across molecular simulations, soft matter, biophysics and more to connect. 

MDAnalysis strives to be a diverse and welcoming community for all. While the event will be free to attend, a limited number of bursaries are available to enable attendance for those facing financial barriers. If you would like to apply, please follow the prompts on the registration form to **submit your bursary application by June 23, 2023**. 

Follow our [official event page][ugmPage] on our website for the most up-to-date information about the UGM. If you have any questions or special requests, you may contact [ugm@mdanalysis.org][email]. We look forward to seeing you in Lisbon!
