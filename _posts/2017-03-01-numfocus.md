We are glad to announce that, since February 2017, MDAnalysis is officially
a [NumFOCUS affiliated](http://www.numfocus.org/affliated-projects.html)
project. With this affiliation, MDAnalysis establishes itself as part of the
wider scientific python ecosystem, and we hope it will open up new opportunities 
in the future.

[NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports and
promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific computing, reproducible 
research, and education in data science.
