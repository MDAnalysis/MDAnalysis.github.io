NumFOCUS is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports and promotes world-class,
innovative, open source scientific computing, reproducible research, and
education in data science. 

We are glad to announce that, since February 2017, MDAnalysis is officially
a [NumFOCUS affiliated](http://www.numfocus.org/affliated-projects.html)
project. With this affiliation, MDAnalysis establish itself as part of the
wider scientific python ecosystem, and we hope it will open many oportunities.
