title: Release 2.10.0 of MDAnalysis
---

We are happy to release version 2.10.0 of MDAnalysis!

This is a minor release of the MDAnalysis library, which means that it
contains enhancements, bug fixes, deprecations, and other
backwards-compatible changes.


## Supported environments

This release supports NumPy 2.0+ and offers backwards compatibility
through to NumPy 1.26.0.

Supported Python versions: **3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14**.
Note: not all optional dependencies currently work with Python 3.14.

Supported Operating Systems:
  - **Linux** (on [x86-64][])
  - **Windows** (on [x86-64][])
  - **MacOS** (on [x86-64][] and [ARM64][])


## Upgrading to MDAnalysis version 2.10.0

To update with `mamba` (or `conda`)  from the [conda-forge channel][] run

```bash
mamba update -c conda-forge mdanalysis
```

To update from [PyPi][] with `pip` run

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis
```

For more help with installation see the [installation instructions in the User Guide][]. 
Make sure you are using a Python version compatible with MDAnalysis 
before upgrading (Python >= 3.11).
