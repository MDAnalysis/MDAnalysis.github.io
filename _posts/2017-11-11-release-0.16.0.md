title: Release 0.16.0
---

We have just released MDAnalysis version 0.16.0. This release contains new
features as well as bug fixes. Highlights are listed below but for more details
see the [release notes](https://github.com/MDanalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/...).

This is the biggest release we ever had with tons of new features. It includes a
rewrite of the topology system, the work of our GSoC students Fiona Naughton
(@fiona-naughton) and John Detlefs (@jdetle), a complete new ensemble analysis
with [encore]({% post_url 2016-12-17-encore %}) and much more. In total **XX**
people contributed **XX** commits to this release. We closed **XX** issues and merged
**XX** pull requests.

# Upgrade

You can upgrade with `pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis` . If you use the conda
package manager run `conda update -c conda-forge mdanalysis`


# Noticable Changes

## Rewrite of our internal topology representation

This is the change we are most exited about for this release. It brings
performance enhancements, makes maintaining the code easier, it's easier to
extend and allowed us a simplification of the interface. We have previously
written about the details of
new [topology system]({% post_url 2016-05-16-release-0.15.0 %}).

But with this change also a lot of deprecated functions have been removed. For
all of the deprecated functions the new replacements already exists and you will
get a warning with a suggested change. The easiest way to check if your scripts
will run without a problem after the update is to include the following on top
of it.

{% highlight python %}
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('always', module='MDAnalysis')
{% endhighlight %}

This will print a warning for every deprecated function you are using together
with a short code snippet how your code has to be changed. If you do not want to
upgrade your existing scripts
we [posted a guide]({% post_url 2017-04-7-environments %}) how to use conda and
python environments to run different versions of MDAnalysis on the same
computer.

## Attach arbitrary time series to your trajectories

Our GSoC student @fiona-naughton has implemented an auxillary reader to add
arbitrary time series to a universe. The time series are kept in sync with the
trajectory so it is possible to iterate through the trajectory and access the
auxiliary data corresponding to the current time step.

{% highlight python %}
import MDAnalysis as mda

# Create your universe as usual
universe = mda.Universe(SIMULATION)
# Attach an auxiliary time serie with the name `pull_force`
universe.trajectory.add_auxiliaty('pull_force', 'md_f.xvg')
# Itarete through your trajectory, the time serie is kept in sync
for time_step in universe.trajectory:
    print(time_step.aux.pull_force)
{% endhighlight %}

@fiona-naugthon worked at offering several convenient way to iterate through your
data. Read the [documentation](aux-doc) or [Fiona's blog posts](fiona-blog) to learn more about the feature.

This feature is still in its beginning and will be expanded in future releases. You can
follow the conversation on the [initial issue](issue785) or on the [pull request](pr868).
So far, only the XVG format used by [gromacs] and [grace] are supported. Open an issue
if you need support for other time series formats.

## Do a dimension reduction with PCA and Diffusion Maps

@jdetle has implemented two new dimension reduction algorithms,
[Principal Component Analysis](pca) and [Diffusion Maps](dmaps-paper). Both can
be found in the analysis submodule. As an example lets look at the first two PCA
dimensions of ADK from our test files.

{% highlight python %}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import MDAnalyis as mda
from MDAnalysis.analysis.pca import PCA
from MDAnalyisTests.datafiles import PSF, DCD

plt.style.use('ggplot')

u = mda.Universe(PSF, DCD)
pca = PCA(u, select='protein and name CA', verbose=True).run()
reduced_data = pca.transform(ca, n_components=2)

f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(d[:, 0], d[:, 1], 'o')
ax.set(xlabel=r'PC$_1$ [$\AA$]', ylabel=r'PC$_2$ [$\AA$]', title='PCA of ADK')
{% endhighlight %}

## Convenience functions to create a new analysis

A while back we introduced a new frame work for analysis to unify the API for
the different analysis methods we offer. With this release we also add a new
class `AnalysisFromFunction` to make it easier to calculate observables from a
simulation. Now code like this with a handwritten loop.

{% highlight python %}
result = []
for ts in u.trajectory:
    result.append(u.atoms.center_of_geometry())
results = np.asarray(results)
{% endhighlight %}

Can now be converted into this.

{% highlight python %}
from MDAnalyis.analysis.base import AnalysisFromFunction
cog = AnalysisFromFunction(lambda ag : ag.center_of_geometry(), u.atoms).run()
cog.results
{% endhighlight %}

This class also takes arguments to adjust the iteration (`start`,`stop`,`step`)
and you can add verbosity with `verbose=True` . You will also profit from any
performance improvements in the analysis class in the future without changing
your code. If you have a specific observable that you want to calculate several
times you can also create a new analysis class with `analysis_class` like this.

{% highlight python %}
from MDAnalyis.analysis.base import analysis_class

def cog(ag):
    return ag.center_of_geometry()

COG = analysis_class(cog)

cog_results = COG(u.atoms, step=2, verbose=True).run()
{% endhighlight %}

## Speed improvements in RMSD

Thanks for work from our NSF REU student @rbrtdlgd our RMSD calculations are about 40% faster now.
If you are using the low-level qcprot algorithm yourself instead of our provided
wrappers you have to change your code since the API has changed. For more see
the [CHANGELOG].

## MemoryReader: Reading trajectories from memory

MDAnalysis typically reads trajectories from files on-demand, so that it can efficiently deal with large trajectories - even those that do not fit in memory. However, in some cases, both for convenience and for efficiency, it can be an advantage to work with trajectories directly in memory. In this release, we have introduced a MemoryReader, which makes this possible. This Reader has been originally implemented in the encore package.

The MemoryReader works with numpy arrays, using the same format as that used by for instance `DCDReader.timeseries()`. You can create a Universe directly from such an array:

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
from MDAnalysis import Universe
from MDAnalysisTests.datafiles import DCD, PSF
from MDAnalysis.coordinates.memory import MemoryReader

# Create a Universe using a DCD reader
universe = Universe(PSF, DCD)

# Create a numpy array with random coordinates (100 frames) for the same topology
coordinates = np.random.uniform(size=(100, universe.atoms.n_atoms, 3)).cumsum(0)

# Create a new Universe directly from these coordinates
universe2 = Universe(PSF, coordinates, format=MemoryReader)
{% endhighlight %}

The MemoryReader will work just as any other reader. In particular, you can iterate over it as usual, or use the `.timeseries()` method to retrieve a reference to the raw array:

{% highlight python %}
coordinates_fac = universe2.trajectory.timeseries(format='fac')
{% endhighlight %}

Certain operations can be speeded up by moving a trajectory to memory, and we have therefore
added functionality to directly transfer any existing trajectory to a MemoryReader using `Universe.transfer_to_memory`:

{% highlight python %}
universe = Universe(PSF, DCD)
universe.transfer_to_memory()     # Switches to a MemoryReader representation
{% endhighlight %}

You can also do this directly upon construction of a Universe, by using the `in_memory` flag:

{% highlight python %}
universe = Universe(PSF, DCD, in_memory=True)
{% endhighlight %}

Likewise, the `AlignTraj` class in the analysis/align.py module also has an `in_memory` flag, allowing it to do in-place alignments.

## Others

We also blogged since the start of the year about features of the upcoming release. 

- [inclusion of the encore library]({% post_url 2016-12-17-encore %})
- [mmtf support]({% post_url 2016-11-30-Support-for-MMTF %})

# Minor Enhancements

- No more deprecation warning spam when MDAnalyis is imported
- analysis.align has a new AlignTraj class following the analysis class style
- all new analysis classes now print additional information with the `verbose=True`.
- RMSD has been ported to the new analysis class style
