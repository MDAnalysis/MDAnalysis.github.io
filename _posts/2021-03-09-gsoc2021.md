# Project Ideas

If you have your own idea about a potential project we'd love to work
with you to develop this idea; please write to us on the [developer
list][mailing list] to discuss it there.

We also have listed several [possible projects][ideas] for you to work
on, on our wiki. Our initial list of ideas (see summaries in the
table below) contains 6 projects at different levels of difficulties
and with different skill requirements. However, check the [ideas][]
page — we might add more ideas after the posting date of this post.

You don't need to have all the skills that we are listing, although
that helps, of course. But you need to demonstrate to us that you're
able and keen to learn anything that you don't know yet, and we will
be happy to help you learn during your project with us.

# Information for Students

You must meet our [own requirements] if you want to be a student with MDAnalysis
this year (read all the docs behind these links!). You must also meet the
[eligibility criteria]. Our [GSoC FAQ][] collects common questions
from students.

The MDAnalysis community values diversity and is committed to
providing a productive, harassment-free to every member. Our [Code of
Conduct] explains the values that we as a community uphold. *Every
member (and every GSoC student) agrees to follow the [Code of
Conduct]*.

As a start to get familiar with MDAnalysis and open source development you
should follow these steps:

## Complete the Quick Start Guide

We have a [Quick Start Guide] explaining the basics of MDAnalysis. You
should go through it at least once to understand how MDAnalysis is
used. Continue reading the [User Guide] to learn more.

## Introduce yourself to us

Introduce yourself on the [mailing list]. Tell us what you plan to work
on during the summer or what you have already done with MDAnalysis.

## Close an issue of MDAnalysis

You must have *at least one commit in the development branch of
MDAnalysis* in order to be eligible, i.e. you must demonstrate that
you have been seriously engaged with the MDAnalysis project.
We have a list of [easy bugs][] and suggested [GSOC Starter
issues][GSOC Starter] to work on in our issue tracker on GitHub. We
also appreciate if you write more tests or update/improve our
documentation.

We recommend you start your application by working on an issue. It will give
you a better understanding of MDAnalysis as a project and improve the quality
of your application.

To start developing for MDAnalysis have a look at our
guide on [contributing to MDAnalysis][dev-guide] and write to us on
the [mailing list][] if you have more questions about setting up a
development environment or how to contribute.
