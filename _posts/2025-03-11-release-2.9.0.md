title: Release 2.9.0 of MDAnalysis
---

We are happy to release version 2.9.0 of MDAnalysis!

This is a minor release of the MDAnalysis library, which means that it
contains enhancements, bug fixes, deprecations, and other
backwards-compatible changes.


## Supported environments

This release supports NumPy 2.0+ and offers backwards compatibility
through to NumPy 1.23.2.

Supported Python versions: **3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13**.

Supported Operating Systems:
  - **Linux** (on [x86-64][])
  - **Windows** (on [x86-64][])
  - **MacOS** (on [x86-64][] and [ARM64][])


## Upgrading to MDAnalysis version 2.9.0

To update with `mamba` (or `conda`)  from the [conda-forge channel][] run

```bash
mamba update -c conda-forge mdanalysis
```

To update from [PyPi][] with `pip` run

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis
```

For more help with installation see the [installation instructions in the User Guide][]. 
Make sure you are using a Python version compatible with MDAnalysis 
before upgrading (Python >= 3.10).


## Notable changes

For a full list of changes, bug fixes and deprecations see the [CHANGELOG][].

#### Enhancements:

* Support for Gromacs v2024.4 and v2025 TPR files.
* A new "water" keyword for selecting water residues.
* Support for **[distopia][] 0.4.0** as an optional distance library
  backend that now supports [many more distance
  functions](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/lib/distances.html#id2)
  for *all box types* (including general triclinic unit cells).
  
  On supported [x86-64][] platforms, install *distopia* with
  ```bash
  mamba install -c conda-forge distopia
  ```
  
  You can then [enable *distopia* as a
  backend](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/lib/distances.html#use-of-the-distopia-library)
  to make use of the optimized *distopia* code for 
  compute-intensive distance calculations, such as
  [`distance_array()`](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/lib/distances.html#MDAnalysis.lib.distances.distance_array):
  
  ```python
  protein = u.select_atoms("protein and not name H*")
  lipids = u.select_atoms("resname POPC CHOL and not name H*")
  d = MDAnalysis.lib.distances.distance_array(protein, lipids,
                                              box=u.dimensions, 
                                              backend="distopia")
  ```
  
  If you want to see if *distopia* is available as a backend in a running
  program, check that the variable `MDAnalysis.lib.distances.HAS_DISTOPIA` is
  `True`.
  
* Parallel analysis support for `MDAnalysis.analysis.nucleicacids`, `MDAnalysis.analysis.contacts`, and `MDAnalysis.analysis.density`.
* XYZ writer can now write positions up to a user-supplied precision via the `precision` keyword argument.
  

#### Changes:

* `MDAnalysis.analysis.hole2`, `MDAnalysis.analysis.psa`, and
  `MDAnalysis.analysis.waterdynamics`, are now only available via
  optional dependencies (the mdahole2, pathsimanalysis, and
  waterdynamics [MDAKits][]). By default these will not be installed, you
  will need to install them separately if you wish to use them from
  within `MDAnalysis.analysis`. Please
  note that *in v3.0* theses modules will be *removed completely from the
  MDAnalysis core library* and you will need to use the MDAKits
  directly.
* `fasteners` dependency has been switched to `filelock`.
* Codebase is now formatted with black (version 24)
