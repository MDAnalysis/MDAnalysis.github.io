We are happy to announce that thanks to a [NumFOCUS development grant][numfocus]
we will be hosting a 2 day workshop and hackathon aimed at introducing researchers to MDAnalysis.
The event will be free to attend and will be held at Northwestern University, Evanston IL on the 12th and 13th of November 2018.
In addition, there are travel grants available for people attending from outside Chicago
aimed at promoting diversity in STEM.  Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply!

The first day of the workshop will focus on covering the basics of the Python programming language
and an introduction to the MDAnalysis library.
The second day will cover how to apply MDAnalysis to your own research data.
The workshop will conclude with a hackathon which will teach you how to start
contributing to open source software.
