Thanks to the support of a [Small Development Grant](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants) awarded to MDAnalysis by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), MDAnalysis is excited to start working with Namir Oues (@namiroues) as the *Technical Writer* for the funded project, "Unified and comprehensive documentation and learning resources for MDAnalysis", with the goal to make it easier for new users to find the right resources to be productive with MDAnalysis.

MDAnalysis has an ever-expanding international community of users and developers. Thorough documentation and extensive learning resources -- such as tutorials and online workshop materials -- are publicly available to users under open source licenses; however, a considerable amount of overlap between the many resources (e.g., [website]({{ site.baseurl }}), [user guide]({{ site.docs.userguide }}), [docs]({{ site.docs.mdanalysis.url }}), [GitHub wiki]({{ site.github.wiki }})) can make it somewhat difficult for self-learners to find the information they need.

As Technical Writer, [Namir](#meet-namir-oues) is tasked with consolidating the main website and additional MDAnalysis learning resources to guide users through a more streamlined workflow by removing duplication and outdated materials and more clearly delineating between developer-focused and user-focused content. A  primary objective of this project is to enhance the user experience for newcomers to MDAnalysis and encourage continued growth in our user and developer communities.
