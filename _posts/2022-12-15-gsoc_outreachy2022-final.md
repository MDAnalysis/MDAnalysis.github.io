This year MDAnalysis participated in two programs with wonderful contributors from around the globe. 
We continued our participation in [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] for another year and also participated in [Outreachy][outreachy] for the first time. 
Huge thanks to these organisations for supporting MDAnalysis and the students.
