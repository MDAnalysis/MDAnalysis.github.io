title: Google Summer of Code Students 2021

We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis is hosting two [GSoC][gsoc]
students this year -- @ojeda-e, and @orioncohen. MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own
[organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] for a second year running and we are grateful to Google for granting us
two student slots for two exciting projects. Both the students and mentors have a very exciting few months ahead!

## Estefania Barreto-Ojeda: An MDAnalysis module to calculate membrane curvature
