title: Google Summer of Code Students 2021
---

We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis is hosting two [GSoC][gsoc]
students this year -- @ojeda-e, and @orioncohen. MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own
[organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] for a second year running and we are grateful to Google for granting us
two student slots for two exciting projects. Both the students and mentors have a very exciting few months ahead!

## Estefania Barreto-Ojeda: An MDAnalysis module to calculate membrane curvature

The macroscopic behavior of a liquid is determined by its microscopic
structure. For ionic systems, like batteries and many enzymes, the solvation
environment surrounding ions is especially important. By studying the solvation
of interesting materials, scientists can better understand, engineer, and
design new technologies. The aim of this project is to implement a robust
and cohesive set of methods for solvation analysis that would be widely
useful in both biomolecular and battery electrolyte simulations. The core of
the solvation module will be a cohesive set of functions for easily working
with ionic solvation shells. Building from that core functionality, the
module will implement several analysis methods for analyzing ion pairing,
ion speciation, residence times, and shell association and dissociation.

Orion is a Ph.D. student at the University of California Berkeley, working
with Dr. Kristin Persson at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. His
work leverages high-throughput chemical simulations and machine learning to
discover new materials for Lithium-ion batteries. Orion is passionate about
making science more accessible, reproducible, and efficient with powerful
open-source software. If he isn't toiling at his computer, Orion is probably
playing board games, camping, or relaxing in the temperate Berkeley sun.
