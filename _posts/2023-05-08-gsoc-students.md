title: Google Summer of Code Students 2023
---

We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis is hosting two [GSoC][gsoc] students this year - [@xhgchen](https://github.com/xhgchen) and [@marinegor](https://github.com/marinegor). MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own [organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] for the fourth year running, and we are grateful to Google for granting us the opportunity to get started on _two_ very exciting GSoC projects!

## Xu Hong Chen: Add calculations for self-diffusivity and viscosity

Write something about your project and yourself here (don't forget to link to the project page on the GSoC website)!

Add where we can find you here! (github, twitter, others)

Add a link to your blog here!
