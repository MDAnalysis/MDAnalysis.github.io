title: Google Summer of Code Students 2022
---

We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis is hosting two [GSoC][gsoc] students this year - @xhgchen and @marinegor. MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own [organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] for the fourth year running, and we are grateful to Google for granting us the opportunity to get started on _two_ very exciting GSoC projects!

## Xu Hong Chen: Add calculations for self-diffusivity and viscosity
