We are happy to release version 1 of MDAnalysis!


MDAnalysis 1.x is a stable legacy platform that supports 

-  Python 2.7 (on Linux and MacOS only), 
-  Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 (on Windows (32- and 64-bit), MacOS, and Linux).

The API will not change for any upcoming 1.x versions.
This release completes the first phase of our [roadmap][].
From here on, we will focus on developing version 2 of MDAnalysis, which will support Python 3.6+ only, and will include major API changes and improvements.


The 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.1.1 versions of MDAnalysis are the product of more than 18 months effort.
They contain a multitude of **fixes**, [**deprecations**](#deprecations), and **new features**.
We highlight important changes below, but users are strongly encouraged to read the [CHANGELOG][] for full details.
All users are recommended to upgrade to 1.1.1, as it includes [important fixes](#important-fixes).


## Upgrading to MDAnalysis version 1.1.1

In [Dependencies](#dependencies) we list the required dependencies of MDAnaysis version 1; when installing with `pip` or `conda`, the correct dependencies should be automatically pulled in by the package manager:

To install with `conda` from the [conda-forge channel][] run

```bash
conda update -c conda-forge mdanalysis
```

(Note that for Python 2.7 and 3.5, no conda packages are currently available due to the difficulty of building packages for legacy Python versions. Please install with `pip`.)

To install from [PyPi][] with `pip` run

```bash
pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis
```

(This will likely build the package from source so you need the appropriate compilers. )

For more help with installation see the [Installation instructions in the User Guide][].


## Notable new additions

We now support several new formats:
- [FHI-aims](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/formats/reference/in)
- [NAMD binary coordinates](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/formats/reference/coor)
- [ITP files from GROMACS](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/formats/reference/itp)

We have also added [*converters*](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/converters) to and from other popular analysis packages.
We plan to expand in this exciting direction in future versions, as laid out in our [interoperability][] roadmap.
For now, we support:
- [ParmEd objects](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/formats/reference/parmed)
- [the chemfiles library](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/formats/reference/chemfiles)

New additions to analysis include:
- `frames` and `times` attributes to AnalysisBase to capture the frames and times that the analysis was `run()` on. This is accessible to all analyses that subclass AnalysisBase.
- a [correlations module](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/lib/correlations.html) for computing the discrete autocorrelation function
- a new [HydrogenBondAnalysis](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/analysis/hydrogenbonds.html) class for improved and more efficient analysis of hydrogen bonds, which replaces the now deprecated [hbond_analysis](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/analysis/hbond_analysis.html) code
- an [AverageStructure](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/analysis/align.html#MDAnalysis.analysis.align.AverageStructure) class for computing the average structure of a trajectory out of memory
- a [hole2](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/analysis/hole2.html) module for improved interfacing with the HOLE2 program, which replaces the now deprecated [hole](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/analysis/hole.html) module
- a [DensityAnalysis](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/analysis/density.html#MDAnalysis.analysis.density.DensityAnalysis) class for improved density analysis, replacing the now deprecated [density_from_Universe()](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/analysis/density.html#MDAnalysis.analysis.density.density_from_Universe) code
- a method to compute the root-mean-square-inner-product of subspaces
- a method to calculate the cumulative overlap of a vector in a subspace

Other additions to core functionality include:
- [wrap and unwrap on-the-fly transformations](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/transformations/wrap.html)
- methods to add [bonds][add_bonds], [angles][add_angles], [dihedrals][add_dihedrals], and [impropers][add_impropers] to a Universe
- methods to delete [bonds][del_bonds], [angles][del_angles], [dihedrals][del_dihedrals], and [impropers][del_impropers] from a Universe
- the [get_connections][] method to get bonds, angles, dihedrals and impropers in an AtomGroup, with the ability to specify whether all atoms involved are within the AtomGroup (`outside=False`), or whether *at least one* atom involved is within the AtomGroup (`outside=True`)

Miscellaneous performance improvements include:
- Dihedral selection in the Ramachandran class has been sped up ~700x.
- TPR parsing has been sped up 2–30x.

## Notable improvements

We have improved the flexibility to our atom selection language, allowing for advanced pattern matching operators.

For example, we now support `?` for single character matching, so using `resname T?R` in a selection string for a protein would yield both residues `THR` and `TYR`. More information can be found in our [selection documentation](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/selections.html#pattern-matching).

Notable changes to analysis include:
- The argument order to AnalysisFromFunction are now as specified in the documentation
- The `select` keyword has been standardized by removing `selection`, `atomselection`, and `ref_select` in the `contact`, `gnm`, `helanal`, `hole`, `encore`, and `hydrogenbonds` modules
- The `save()` functions have been removed from `contacts`, `diffusionmap`, `hole`, `lineardensity`, and `rms` modules
- Progress bars have been replaced with an improved version from [tqdm][]
- The `radius_cut_q` method has been added to [contacts.Contacts](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/1.1.1/documentation_pages/analysis/contacts.html#MDAnalysis.analysis.contacts.Contacts)


Other notable improvements to the core functionality include:
- AtomGroup.guess_bonds now uses periodic boundary information when available
- The TPRParser now supports GROMACS 2020
- When reading PDB and XYZ files, MDAnalysis now adds an `elements` attribute if the provided elements are valid

## Important fixes

For the full list of fixed please see the [CHANGELOG][]. The following are selection of fixes that could have either lead to wrong results or were often reported by users as problematic:

### Core

- Neighbor searching, which is a fundamental component of many analyses in MDAnalysis (such as hydrogenbonds and RDF calculation) had a number of bugs in 1.0.0 that could lead to wrong results, in particular with triclinic unit cells. The buggy code was disabled in 1.0.1 and fixed in 1.1.1. See issues [#2229][], [#2345][], [#2919][], [#2670][] [#2930][] for details.
- Fixed a SegmentationFault for the selection "around 0.0 SELECTION" (Issue [#2656][])
- `AtomGroup.center()` now works correctly for compounds and unwrapping (Issue [#2984][])
- When bonds are guessed from distances (`AtomGroup.guess_bonds`), periodic boundary information is properly taken into account. Bonds that were split across the periodic boundary would have not beend correctly guessed previously. (Issue [#2350][])
- The testsuite does not fail anymore with newer version of matplotlib (Issue [#2191][])


### File formats
- **PDB** files
  - Better handling of cryo-electron microscopy box dimensions in PDB files:
    - When a PDB file is read, a cryo-em 1 Å<sup>3</sup> default CRYST1 record will be interpreted as "no dimensions" and the box dimension in MDAnalysis is set to ``None`` (Issue [#2599][])
    - When box dimensions are missing (`u.dimensions` is `None` or `np.zeros(6)`) then a  unitary `CRYST1` record (cubic box with sides of 1 Å) is written (Issue [#2679][])
  - PDB files no longer lose chainIDs when reading files without segIDs (Issue [#2389][])
  - PDBWriter now uses first character of segid as ChainID (Issue [#2224][])
- In **GRO** files, unit cells with box vectors larger than 1000 nm are now correctly handled (Issue [#2371][])
- Reading of **XTC** and **TRR** files will not anymore fail with an `IOError` when the hidden offset files cannot be read; instead, the offsets are recalculated from the trajectory (Issue [#1893][])
- Masses and charges in **HooMD XML** files are now correctly read ([#2888][])

### Analysis
- **PCA** analysis:
  - `PCA(align=True)` now correctly aligns the trajectory and computes the correct means and covariance matrix (Issue [#2561][])
  - Specifying `n_components` now correctly selects the PCA components (Issue [#2623][])
- **Contact** Analysis class respects PBC (Issue [#2368][])

## Deprecations

This release brings several deprecations as the package heads towards version 2.0.0.

The following parts of the analysis code will be removed/changed in version 2.0.0:
- analysis.hole is deprecated in favor of analysis.hole2.
- analysis.hbonds.HydrogenBondsAnalysis is deprecated in favor of analysis.hydrogenbonds.hbond_analysis.
- analysis.density.density_from_Universe() is deprecated in favor of analysis.density.DensityAnalysis.
- The notwithin_coordinates_factory() and density_from_PDB() methods of analysis.density are deprecated.
- analysis.waterdynamics.HydrogenBondLifetimes is deprecated in favor of analysis.hydrogenbonds.hbond_analysis.HydrogenBondAnalysis.lifetime() (to be implemented in version 2.0.0)
- analysis.leaflets.LeafletFinder() will no longer accept a filename, in 2.0.0 only Universes will be supported as inputs.
- analysis.helanal is deprecated and will be replaced by analysis.helix_analysis in 2.0.0.
- analysis.hbonds.WaterBridgeAnalysis will be moved to analysis.hydrogenbonds.WaterBridgeAnalysis.


The following parts of the readers/writers will be removed/changed in version 2.0.0:
- Writer.write_next_timestep() is deprecated in favor of Writer.write().
- Passing Timestep objects to Writer.write() is deprecated. In 2.0.0 only Universe or AtomGroup objects will be accepted.
- The way in which the NCDFWriter handles scale factors will change in version 2.x (see Issue #2327 for more details).
- When writing PDB files, MDAnalysis will no longer be using the last letter of the SegID to set the chainID in version 2.0.0.
- The `bfactors` and `tempfactors` attributes (set by the PDB and MMTF parsers respectively), will be aliased in version 2.0.0.
- When parsing TPR files, resids will be indexed from 1 rather than the current default of 0.

The following part of the core and library components will be removed/changed in version 2.0.0:
- lib.log.echo() is deprecated in favor of the new lib.log.ProgressBar.
- core.universe.as_Universe() is deprecated.
