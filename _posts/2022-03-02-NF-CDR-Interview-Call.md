title: Call for participation - NumFOCUS open-source DEI research project
---

MDAnalysis is working with our fiscal sponsor [NumFOCUS][] on a [research project][] funded by the [Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation][] to understand the barriers to participation that contributors, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups, face in the open-source software community. The NumFOCUS research team would like to talk to past and current (both new or long-term) contributors, project developers and maintainers  about their experiences joining and contributing to MDAnalysis.

### _Interested in sharing your experiences?_

Please complete this brief “[Participant Interest][]” form which also contains additional information on the research goals, privacy, and confidentiality considerations. Your participation will be valuable to enabling the growth and sustainability of diverse and inclusive open-source software communities. Accepted participants will participate in a 30-minute interview with a NumFOCUS research team member.

Thank you for your interest!

- @IAlibay and @fiona-naughton on behalf of the MDAnalysis Core Developer team
