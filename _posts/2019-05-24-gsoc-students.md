We are happy to anounce that MDAnalysis is hosting one [GSoC][gsoc]
students for [NumFOCUS][numfocus] this year, [Ninad Bhat][ninad-gsoc] (@NinadBhat) on GitHub).

# Ninad Bhat: Better Periodic Boundary Handling

Molecular simulations are predominantly ran under periodic boundary
conditions, i.e., upon leaving one face of the simulation volume, you
re-enter in the opposite face. This can lead to molecules being split
over the periodic boundary, which requires rectification before
performing calculations. In this project, Ninad will implement
wrapping and unwrapping functionality in the various AtomGroup methods
that use the position of particles, e.g., the calculation of the
center of mass. In order to improve performance, the wrapping and
unwrapping methods will be implemented in Cython.


Ninad is a senior undergraduate at IIT Bombay. He is working with
Phase Field Modelling for his master thesis and has also used
molecular dynamics for some of his projects. He has been contributing
to different open source projects since 2016 and credits most of his
programming knowledge to it. During GSoC, he aims to improve his
software development skills while also getting a deeper understanding
of molecular dynamics.


Ninad will describe his progress on [his blog][ninad-blog].
