---

We are pleased to announce the [2025 MDAnalysis UGM][ugmPage] (User Group Meeting), taking place on the 9-11th November, 2025, in Arizona, USA at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). [Abstracts][abstracts] are welcomed from all areas relevant to MDAnalysis's work, from scientific applications (e.g., biomolecular simulations, soft matter and materials science, drug discovery and more) to the use and development of open source software and tools for molecular simulations data analysis. Additionally this UGM will have sessions focusing on ongoing work towards enabling simulation streaming being undertaken at ASU (see our previous [workshop][streaming_workshop] on this topic). When submitting your abstract, you may indicate whether you prefer to give a 15 minute talk, 5 minute lighting talk, or poster presentation.

MDAnalysis strives to be a diverse and welcoming community for all. A limited number of travel bursaries are available to enable those facing financial barriers to attend and present their work. If you would like to apply, please follow the prompts on the [abstract submission form][abstracts].

The deadline for submitting your abstract and/or bursary application is **July 15th, 2025**. Submissions will be reviewed by the end of July 2025; we will contact applicants shortly after.

Follow the [official event page][ugmPage] on our website for the most up-to-date information about the UGM. If you have any questions or special requests, please contact [ugm@mdanalysis.org][email].
