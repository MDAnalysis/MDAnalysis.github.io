---

We are now [accepting abstracts][abstracts] for the [2025 MDAnalysis UGM][ugmPage] (User Group Meeting), taking place Nov 11-12, 2025, in Arizona, USA at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). Abstracts are welcomed from all areas relevant to MDAnalysis's work, from scientific applications (e.g., biomolecular simulations, soft matter and materials science, drug discovery and more) to the use and development of open source software and tools for molecular simulations data analysis. Additionally this UGM will have sessions focusing on ongoing work on simulation streaming work being undertaken at ASU. When submitting your abstract, you may indicate whether you prefer to give a 15 minute talk, 5 minute lighting talk, or poster presentation.

MDAnalysis strives to be a diverse and welcoming community for all. While the event will be free to attend, a limited number of travel bursaries are available to enable those facing financial barriers to attend and present their work. If you would like to apply, please follow the prompts on the [abstract submission form][abstracts].

The deadline for submitting your abstract and/or bursary application is **XX, 2025**. Submissions will be reviewed by the end of March 2024; we will contact applicants shortly after.
