We are happy to announce the first version of a command-line interface (CLI)
of MDAnalysis!
The CLI allows users to calculate radial distribution
functions (RDF), Root-mean-square deviations (RMSD), and many more directly from
the command line. For example, extracting
the RDF between the water oxygens is just one line of code

    mda interrdf -s topol.tpr -f traj.trr -g1 "name OW" -g2 "name OW"

For a detailed synopsis and a list of all available modules check the
sections below as well as
the [documentation][documentation] or the [repository][github].

Providing easier access to the library for day-to-day analysis,
``mdacli`` is not only for the MDAnalysis community but 
also perfect for non-Python users.
The project evolved from the experiences of @joaomcteixeira in
[TaurenMD][taurenmd] and from @PiCoCentauri in [MAICoS][maicos].

## Installation

Install ``mdacli`` from ``PyPI``

    pip install mdacli

A Conda build will be released soon.

## Examples

To use ``mdacli``, after installation
open your terminal and run

    mda -h

This command provides a list of all available modules similar to the 
in the [documentation][documentation].
The synopsis for calculating a radial distribution function (RDF) 
between two groups is given by

    mda interrdf -h

A sample water trajectory is provided of rigid SPC/E water is
provided [testfiles][testfiles].
`topol.tpr` is a GROMACS topolgy file and `traj.trr`
the corresponding trajectory. The oxygen-oxygen
RDF can be calculated using

    mda interrdf -s topol.tpr -f traj.trr -g1 "name OW" -g2 "name OW"

The oxygens are selected with the `-g1` and `-g2` flags.
More verbose output is achieved by using the `-v` flag. Even more,
information is provided with the `--debug` flag.
All warnings of the run can also be directly stored to a 
log file using the `--logfile` flag

    mda --debug --logfile rdf.log interrdf -v -s topol.tpr -f traj.trr -g1 "name OW" -g2 "name OW"

The results of each analysis are stored by default in the current directory.
The output directory can be changed with the `-o` flag and an additional prefix can be
set using the `-pre` flag.

The results of the RDF calculations
are two `.csv` files. The actual RDF is saved in the 2nd and 3rd columns
of `InterRDF_count_bins_rdf.csv`. The header rows of each file provide
information about the stored data. Simple results such as bare numbers or
strings are stored as `JSON` dumps. More complex data such as
4 or higher-dimensional arrays are saved as a bunch of CSV files zipped
together.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome on [Github][github]. Not only in the form of
code contributions via pull requests but also issues, especially
since the project is in an early development phase.

## Motivation and Background

The CLI was developed since
we were facing the same problem in the labs regularly.
New students/scientists start writing their analysis
scripts and face the same challenges and problems i.e.

* How to initialize the universe and loop through frames without copying many lines of code?
* How to write a CLI parser to analyze several of their simulations?
* How to process and save their trajectories in a clever way?
* ...

Some of these problems can be solved by using the
`MDAnalysis.analysis.base.AnalysisBase` [class of MDA][mda_analysis]. However,
this class is limited to Python.
A generic CLI wrapper for all classes based on the AnalysisBase could
therefore help people to analyze their simulation
data with the least effort. With this approach, it is easier to use for
MDA-users since they just stay within their known universe
with known selection commands and results structures.
An existing framework makes it also more attractive for users
and developers to write their analysis using the
`base.AnalysisBase`. For more technical details visit the
[documentation][philosophy].
