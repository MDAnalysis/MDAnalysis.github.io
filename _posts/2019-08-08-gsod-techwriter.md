This year MDAnalysis is hosting Lily Wang (@lilyminium on GitHub) for
the first iteration of [Google Season of Docs][GSoD]. She will work
with us over the coming months on [a user guide for MDAnalysis,
structured by topic][GSoD-project].

## Lily Wang: A User Guide for MDAnalysis

MDAnalysis is a library for the analysis of computational (primarily
molecular dynamics, i.e. MD) simulations. Frequently these analyses
are rare, novel, or individual enough that they are not immediately
available as a predefined function within MDAnalysis. MDAnalysis
provides a toolkit for interacting with simulations and constructing
new analyses. Lily will create a high-level user guide structured by
topic. This user guide will describe the building blocks of the data
structures, analysis, topologies, and more. It will be targeted at a
general audience; molecular dynamics users will be able to see the
machine abstraction and technical considerations (e.g. MemoryReader)
under the hood, while developers will be able to gain an understanding
of the scientific background.

Lily Wang is a Ph.D. student at the Australian National University,
Canberra. She aims to improve various aspects of molecular dynamics
simulation over the course of her degree. During GSoD, she hopes to
refine her technical writing skills while contributing to a package
that she very much appreciates. In the tattered remnants of her free
time, she enjoys reading and wandering around mountains. You can
follow her progress on GSoD (and reading) on [her
blog][lily-blog].
