MDAnalysis, in conjunction with the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute][MolSSI]
(MolSSI) and with the support of the [Chan-Zuckerberg Inititative][CZI] and the
[Center for Biological Physics][CBP], is holding a **2-day** workshop on **June
24th-25th** 2024 at **Arizona State University** in Tempe, Arizona, USA.

This two-day workshop is intended to transform attendees from users to
developers and will cover an introduction to MDAnalysis, software best
practices, and guide participants through the creation of their own [MDAKit][mdakits].

### Workshop outline

MDAnalysis developers and experienced MolSSI instructors will teach
participants how to build their own MDAnalysis-based Python packages by guiding
them through the development of their own MDAKits. Specifically, the workshop
will include 3 modules: (1) an introduction to using and writing custom
analyses in MDAnalysis; (2) an overview of software development and maintenance
best practices; and (3) an interactive hackathon session where participants
write their own MDAKits.

The program will run from the morning of Monday, June 24th until the early
evening of Tuesday June 25th. 

Parts of the workshop will be held in a hybrid mode for those unable to attend
in-person. Registration for the hybrid components is required. Recordings of
hybrid sessions will be made available after the workshop.

Breakfast and lunch will will be provided together with tea/coffee during
breaks.



### Registration

Attendance at this workshop will be *free* but limited to 40 in-person
participants.

A number of **bursaries** will be available to assist with travel and
accommodation costs for participants from outside the Phoenix area. Bursaries
(up to *$600 in costs for US domestic travel*) and *up to 3 nights of hotel
accommodation* (single room within 5 minutes of the workshop venue) will be
awarded.

#### Application *with bursary request* (non-local attendees)

Register by **May 27, 2024** (midnight anywhere on Earth).

We especially welcome your application if you consider yourself being part of
an under-represented demographic in the computational molecular sciences.

Bursaries are reserved to enable the attendance of participants from outside
the greater Phoenix area.

Note that airfare for travel awardees will have to be *booked by June 3 through
our travel agency* so as an awardee you will have to be able to
respond to our communications (via email) immediately and act quickly.

Bursary recipients will be notified by May 29. 


#### Application without bursary request or local attendees

Register by **June 5, 2024** (midnight anywhere on Earth).


### Travel

[Tempe][] is part of the "Valley of the Sun" metropolitan area, which encompasses
[Phoenix][], the 5th most populous city in the US. Today the area is home to more
than 4.8 million people and encompasses the ancient lands of the Akimel O'odham
(Pima), Maricopa, and Tohono O'odham tribes.


#### Airport

**Phoenix Sky Harbor** [PHX][] airport has direct connections to all major hubs
in the US.

PHX airport is 5.5 miles (10 minutes by car/rideshare) from the workshop venue.

#### Public transport (Light Rail)

The [Valley Metro Light Rail][Light Rail] connects the airport to Tempe along a
West-East axis. If your destination is near a Light Rail stop then
public transport works well:

1. Take the free [PHX Sky Train][] from the terminal to the **44th St/Washington**
Metro Rail stop.
2. Walk from the Sky Train stop to the Light Rail stop (all inside the 44th St
Sky Train structure)
3. Buy a ticket at the ticket machine near the exit escalators to the Light
Rail stop.
4. At the [44th St/Washington stop][LightRail44thSt] (Stop #10018) take the
*east-bound* Light Rail (direction Mesa, Gilbert Rd/Main St).
5. The stop closest to the Hyatt Place Hotel and the workshop venue is
**University Dr/Rural Rd** (Stop #10023). If you want to get off closer to
downtown Tempe get off one stop earlier at **Veterans Way/College Ave** (Stop #10025)
6. Walk to your destination.

#### Car/rideshare

To get from the airport to anywhere in Tempe either take a cab (traditional or self-driving
Waymo) or rideshare (Lyft, Uber).


#### Workshop Venue

The workshop will be held in the Student Success Center in the Department of
Physics at [Arizona State University][ASU] (room PSF 186 in the [Physical Sciences F
building][PSF]). The address is

  Department of Physics  
  Arizona State University  
  Physical Sciences F Building  
  550 E Tyler Mall, PSF 186  
  Tempe, AZ 85287  
  USA
 
Paid parking is available in the [Tyler Street Parking
Structure][TylerStParking] and other on-campus parking structures.

### Accommodation

The closest hotel (5 min by foot) is the [Hyatt Place Tempe][HyattPlace].

Other hotels are available in Tempe within walking distance.


### Weather

Arizona is *hot* during June. Temperatures in excess of 110ºF (43.3ºC) are not
rare so it is important that you bring a hat for sun protection and carry
enough water with you.

Avoid hiking in the desert during the hot portion of the day (10am - 6pm) as it
can be deadly.
