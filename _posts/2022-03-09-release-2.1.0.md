title: MDAnalysis 2.1 is out
---

We are happy to release the version 2.1.0 of MDAnalysis!

In line with ongoing attempts to keep MDAnalysis closer to [NEP 29][], this version now only supports Python 3.7 to 3.10, in addition to a minimum NumPy version of 1.18.0.

Further details about MDAnalysis' support policy, including our release schedule, will be provided in an upcoming blog post.

## Upgrading to MDAnalysis version 2.1.0

To install with `conda` from the [conda-forge channel][] run

```bash
conda update -c conda-forge mdanalysis
```

To install from [PyPi][] with `pip` run

```bash
pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis
```

For more help with installation see the [installation instructions in the User Guide][].


## Notable new additions

### Dielectric constant analysis

[Mattia Felice Palermo][] and [Philip Loche][] contributed a new analysis module to compute average dipole moments. The module can be accessed as [`MDAnalysis.analysis.dielectric`][]. Here is an example from the documentations:

```python
import MDAnalysis as mda
from MDAnalysis.analysis.dielectric import DielectricConstant
from MDAnalysisTests.datafiles import PSF_TRICLINIC, DCD_TRICLINIC

# Load a pure water system
universe = mda.Universe(PSF_TRICLINIC, DCD_TRICLINIC)

diel = DielectricConstant(universe.atoms)
diel.run()
print(diel.results)
```

```
{'M': array([ 1.54082059, -2.03885814,  3.37261771]), 'M2': array([ 5.71970697, 13.45815613, 18.24527209]), 'fluct': array([3.34557887, 9.3012136 , 6.87072189]), 'eps': array([2.47772633, 5.10830197, 4.0347653 ]), 'eps_mean': 3.873597866567474}
```

### R/S chirality is read from RDKit objects

[Richard Gowers][] made the reading of RDKit molecules aware of the R/S chirality when the information is available. The information can be accessed with the `AtomGroup.chirality` attribute and be used for selections.

```python
import MDAnalysis as mda
from rdkit import Chem

molecule = Chem.MolFromSmiles('CC[C@H](C)[C@H](C(=O)O)N')
universe = mda.Universe(molecule)

# Read the chirality of each atom
universe.atoms.chiralities

# Select atoms from their chirality
universe.select_atoms('element C and chirality S')
```

### Other enhancements

Thanks to [Atharva Kulkarni][], [`MDAnalysis.units.convert`][] knows about milliseconds and microseconds. The function, as the name indicates, converts quantities from one unit to an other.

[Edis Jakupovic][] improved the reading of H5MD files so it can better read files without a topology. For these files, the number of atoms is now read from the positions, velocities, or forces in the trajectory.

Thanks to [Richard Gowers][], again, one can apply the minimum image convention to a collection of vectors using `MDAnalysis.lib.distances.minimize_vectors`.

Thanks to [Jonathan Barnoud][], this version of MDAnalysis is compatible with TPR files produced with Gromacs 2022.

Thanks to [Hugo MacDermott-Opeskin][], you can now specify additional compiler flags for the C/C++ compiler to customise your installation. This can be used to improve performance by using architecture specific flags. See the [detailed instructions in the User Guide][] for more information.


## Other changes

Indexing a group (`AtomGroup`, `ResidueGroup`, or `SegmentGroup`) with `None` now raises a `TypeError`.

As announced with the [previous release][], the TZR reader now defaults to a `dt` of 1.0 ps, instead of 0.0 ps previously, when the time step cannot be read from the file.

For a full list of bugfixes see the [CHANGELOG][].

## Deprecations

In methods of `AtomGroup`. `ResidueGroup`, and `SegmentGroup`, the argument `pbc` has been renamed `wrap`. This name makes the meaning of the argument clearer and mirrors the `unwrap` argument of these same methods. The use of `pbc` is still possible, bt it is deprecated and will be removed in version 3.0.

## Author statistics

Altogether, this represents the work of 14 authors, 6 of which were new contributors:

- @melomcr
- @mdd31
- @scal444
- @edisj
- @Atharva7K
- @yangtcai

MDAnalysis thanks [NumFOCUS][]'s continued support as the organisation's fiscal sponsor.
