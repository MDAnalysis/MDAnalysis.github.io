MDAnalysis has been accepted as an [organization][org] for [Google Summer of
Code][gsoc] (GSoC) 2026! If you are interested in working with us and you
are new to open source, please read the advice and links below to learn how you can apply to participate in GSoC 2026 with MDAnalysis.

The application window **deadline** is **March 31, 2026 - 18:00 UTC**.
As part of the application process you must familiarize
yourself with [Google Summer of Code 2026][gsoc], including eligibility requirements, timelines, and generally how the program works.

We are looking forward to all applications from *any new and beginner
open source contributors or students over 18 years old*; see a full list of the [eligibility requirements][eligibility criteria] in the [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq). Projects
are scoped as either 90-hour (small), 175-hour (medium) or 350-hour (large) size. The
duration can be extended from the standard 8 weeks to up to 12 weeks (for small projects), or from the standard 12 weeks up to 22 weeks (for medium or large projects).

Potential GSoC Contributors are expected to familiarize themselves with application
requirements and mentoring organizations **as soon as possible**. If you are interested in working with us, please read on to learn about [MDAnalysis project ideas](#project-ideas) and [MDAnalysis-specific requirements for putting together your application](#information-for-prospective-gsoc-contributors).

## Project Ideas

If you have your own idea about a potential project we'd love to work with you
to develop this idea; please write to us on the [GSoC with MDAnalysis discussion forum][discussion forum] to discuss it there.

We also have listed several [possible projects][ideas] for you to work on. Our
initial list of ideas (see summaries in the table below) contains various
projects of different scope and with different skill requirements. However,
check the [ideas] page — we might add more ideas after the posting date of
this post.

Our experience shows that having the listed skills increases the
chances that a project will be completed successfully, so we use them
as part of [our decision criteria in choosing GSoC contributors](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/GSoC-Proposal-Review).

This year, MDAnalysis is joining forces with two other open source projects to offer even more far-reaching collaborative projects: [WESTPA]({{ site.github.wiki }}/GSoC-2026-Project-Ideas#westpa) and [Molecular Nodes]({{ site.github.wiki }}/GSoC-2026-Project-Ideas#molecular-nodes).

### Code of Conduct

The MDAnalysis community values diversity and is committed to providing a
productive, harassment-free environment to every member. Our [Code of Conduct]
explains the values that we as a community uphold. *Every community member (and every
GSoC Contributor) agrees to follow the [Code of Conduct]*.

### Familiarize yourself with MDAnalysis and relevant partner projects

As a start to get familiar with MDAnalysis and open source development you
should follow these steps:
1. [Watch the MDAnalysis Trailer](#watch-the-mdanalysis-trailer)
2. [Complete the Quick Start Guide](#complete-the-quick-start-guide)
3. *If applicable to the [project idea](#project-ideas) you are interested in*, [learn more about WESTPA and/or Molecular Nodes](#learn-more-about-westpa-and-molecular-nodes).

#### Watch the MDAnalysis Trailer

The [MDAnalysis Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMAfvwFkD3o) on YouTube
is a one minute introduction to MDAnalysis.

<div class="js-video">
	<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMAfvwFkD3o" frameborder="0"
	allowfullscreen class="video"></iframe>
</div>

There are also additional [introductory videos]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/learning_MDAnalysis/#introductory) available to give you an idea of what problems MDAnalysis is solving.

#### Complete the Quick Start Guide

Start by [installing] the MDAnalysis package. We have a [Quick Start Guide] explaining the basics of MDAnalysis. You should go through it at least once to understand how MDAnalysis is
used. Continue reading the [User Guide] to learn more.

#### Learn More About WESTPA and Molecular Nodes

As some of the [project ideas][ideas] represent collaboration between MDAnalysis and other partner software projects, you should follow the recommended steps linked here to familiarize yourself (as relevant) with [WESTPA]({{ site.github.wiki }}/GSoC-2026-Project-Ideas#westpa) and/or [Molecular Nodes]({{ site.github.wiki }}/GSoC-2026-Project-Ideas#molecular-nodes).

### Interactions and engagement with MDAnalysis

GSoC contributors with MDAnalysis should demonstrate that they have been seriously engaged with the MDAnalysis project (and/or with a relevant [partner software project]({{ site.github.wiki }}/GSoC-2026-Project-Ideas#collaborations)). Submitting a pull request is a great way to know you as a good candidate. As is relevant to the GSoC project idea you are interested in, you should submit your PR in one of the following repositories:
* MDAnalysis organization:  [github.com/MDAnalysis/](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/)
* WESTPA organization: [github.com/westpa/westpa](https://github.com/westpa/westpa/)
* Molecular Nodes repository: [github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes)

We have a list of [easy bugs] and suggested [GSOC Starter issues] to work on in our issue tracker on GitHub. If you want to dive deeper, we encourage you to tackle some of the other issues in our issue tracker or create a new one. We also appreciate contributions which add more tests or update/improve our documentation. Note that some of the [GSoC 2026 Project Ideas][ideas] include related issues that you might want to explore.

To start developing for MDAnalysis have a look at our guide on
[contributing to MDAnalysis][dev-guide] and write to us on the [GSoC with MDAnalysis discussion forum][discussion forum] if you have more questions about setting up a development environment or how to contribute.

### Submit a pre-proposal

We ask you to submit a short **pre-proposal** so that we can evaluate your understanding of the proposed project. In this pre-proposal you tell us what project you’d like to work on, what you consider the major challenges, and how you plan to solve the problem. MDAnalysis developers will review your proposal and then either invite you to continue with your application and participate in a video interview or tell you that we will not consider your application. *Please note that this decision is final, and applicants should only submit **one** pre-proposal.* A rejection is not a judgment on you or your abilities but an assessment of how well you fit the specific requirements of MDAnalysis as a scientific software package — we much rather you spend your energies on contributing to another exciting GSoC project than being rejected later by MDAnalysis. 

**We require GSoC applicants to submit a pre-proposal** that will determine who is then invited to [participate in a video interview](#participate-in-a-video-interview-by-invitation) (see below). If you are invited to participate in an interview and ultimately submit a full application, the pre-proposal will help you gather some of the information you will need to include. 

Submit your pre-proposal via [this submission form][submission form] **as soon as possible, but no later than March 9, 2026**. You should prepare the following information for your pre-proposal:
* Email address
* GitHub handle
* Real name (optional)
* Basic information on your background (e.g., education, relevant experience with MDAnalysis and molecular dynamics or computational physics/chemistry/materials)
* Project title
* Project size (90h, 175h, 350h)
* **Problem:** Describe the problem to be solved. What is the background? What is the overarching question? You can also comment on why this is an interesting or difficult problem. Clearly define the overall goal of what you want to find out.
* **Approach:** Describe how you are going to reach your goal (i.e., answer the overarching question). Which algorithms are you going to use? Are there any libraries or other packages you want to use? Do you need to research different solutions? Be as concrete as possible; you want to convince your audience that it is feasible to solve this problem and you have an idea how to tackle it.
* **Objectives:** Use a numbered list to state 3–5 measurable non-trivial outcomes that you need to achieve in order to reach the overall goal. These are the milestones that you have to reach; they are possibly dependent on each other. For each objective it must be clear how to decide if you fulfilled it or not. Objectives are formulated in terms of actions and deliverables.
* **Interactions:** Describe the interactions you had with maintainers from MDAnalysis (or WESTPA/Molecular Nodes if you plan on working on a collaborative project). Be specific and link to specific instances of interactions (e.g. Pull Requests) if possible. (500 words)

### Participate in a video interview (*by invitation*)

Applicants who are invited for a video interview will be contacted no earlier than 72 hours after they submit their pre-proposal. During the interview (15 minutes), you will discuss your pre-proposal with 1-2 developers. The video may be recorded for evaluation by other developers/mentors. During the interview, you will be required to share your (full) screen and respond live to questions. The interview may involve live programing and discussions of code sections of MDAnalysis that are relevant for your project. The interview will be conducted using Google Chats or an equivalent video conferencing software.

### Submit full proposal (*by invitation*)

If you pass the interview stage, you will be invited to submit your full GSoC proposal through the GSoC site (starting March 16, 2026). We will only review invited proposals.

Please read the additional information on our [expectations for a full proposal](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/Google-Summer-Of-Code#full-proposal).



## Final remarks

**Submit your pre-proposal before March 9, 2026**, but the earlier the better! We will then let you know via the email you provide in the [pre-proposal submission form][submission form] if you have been selected to participate in a video interview and ultimately submit a full application. The GSoC contributor application period opens on March 16, 2026.

Feel free to ask any questions on the [discussion forum]. We are also happy to chat on our [{{ site.discord.name }} Discord server][discord] in the `#gsoc` channel (join with the public [invitation link](https://discord.com/invite/fXTSfDJyxE)). Please note that MDAnalysis as an organization highly values transparency and therefore we strive to *conduct all discussions in public forums* so please ask questions publicly and not via direct messages or emails.

We look forward to working with you in GSoC 2026!
