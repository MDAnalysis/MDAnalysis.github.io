MDAnalysis, in conjunction with [MolSSI](https://molssi.org/), is happy to announce an 
upcoming in-person workshop, to be held **June 24th-25th**, 2024 at **Arizona State University** 
(Tempe Campus). This two-day workshop is intended to transform attendees from users to developers 
and will cover an introduction to MDAnalysis, software best practices, and guide participants 
through the creation of their own [MDAKit]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/mdakits).

Attendance at this workshop will be free. A number of bursaries will be available to assist 
with travel and accommodation costs. Places will be limited, but parts of the workshop will 
be held in a hybrid mode for those unable to attend in-person.

Further details, including on the registration process, will be announced soon.
