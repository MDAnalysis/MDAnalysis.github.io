MDAnalysis, in conjunction with [MolSSI](https://molssi.org/), is happy to announce an 
upcoming in-person workshop, to be held **June 25th-26th** at **Arizona State University** 
(Tempe Campus). This two-day workshop is intended to build attendees from user to developer 
and will cover an introduction to MDAnalysis, software best practices, and guide participants 
through the creation of their own [MDAKit]( https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/mdakits). 

Attendance at this workshop will be free. A number of bursaries will be available to assist 
with travel and accommodation costs. Places will be limited, but parts of the workshop will 
be held in a hybrid mode for those unable to attend in-person.

Further details, including on the registration process, will be announced soon.
