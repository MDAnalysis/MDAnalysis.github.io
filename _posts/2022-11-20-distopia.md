title: Introducing Distopia
---

Calculating Euclidian distances under periodic boundary conditions is a core component in both running and analysing molecular simulations. For example, the calculation of radial distribution functions, hydrogen bonds, structure factors, and many other common analyses require calculation of one or more pairwise Euclidian distances.

The euclidian distance formula under periodic boundary conditions can be expressed as:

$$
R = \sqrt{A}
$$

Many molecular mechanics engines have highly optimised code for calculating distances that often make use of specialised code paths and/or accelerators to achieve maximal performance. However this functionality is often heavily "baked-in" and is not able to be used as a standalone component.

We at MDAnalysis wanted to bring some of this blazing speed to our distance calculations without sacrificing the modularity of MDAnalysis by introducing heavyweight dependencies on a simulation engine.

## Enter Distopia ##

Instead we developed a lightweight C++ / Python package **distopia** that uses explicit x86 SIMD vectorisation to accelerate calculation of Euclidian distances under periodic boundary conditions. The package is small and aims to provide both a Python and C++ layer to interface with if you would like to quickly
calculate some distances! It is available on [PyPi][Distopia PyPi] and [conda forge][Distopia conda-forge] for x86 architectures if you would like to try it out. 

Try one of:

```bash
pip install distopia
```

or,

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge distopia
```

You can also see distopia under development at its home on  [github][Distopia github].

## What advantages does Distopia provide? ##

### Distopia is fast! ###

A comparison of distopia with several different approaches used in different simulation analysis packages is provided in the graph below.
We compare with MDAnalysis's current distance backend, MDTraj's distance backend and freud's distance backend.


We can see that distopia is faster than the approaches taken in the other packages (especially MDAnalysis!). This is due to the extensive efforts
taken to improve vectorisation, data alignment and use low-latency CPU operations. More details about how this is achieved.

### Distopia is easy to use! ###

Distopia is easy to use, with a simple, well documented python layer. Calculating the pairwise distances between two NumPy arrays is as simple as.

 ```python
import distopia

dists = distopia.calc_bonds_ortho_float(coords1, coords2, box) 
 ```

Distopia provides both `float` and `double` precision versions of functions to calculate distances and currently supports orthorhombic
periodic boundary conditions, or no boundary conditions.

### Distopia is open to the community! ###

We don't intend the benchmarks in this blog post to draw attention to relative performance of one package versus another.
Instead we aim to discuss the merits of different approaches and provide an easy to use layer that other packages can adopt if they so wish.

We also welcome all kinds of feedback about distopia on our [github][Distopia github] or on the [MDAnalysis Discord][MDAnalysis discord].

## How does distopia compare to existing approaches? ##

Currently, many simulation analysis packages offer some kind of compiled layer for 
the numerically intensive job of calculating distances. MDAnalysis currently achieves this with a C header wrapped in Cython.

Distopia uses **explicit SIMD vectorisation** along with a set of "array of structs" -> "struct of arrays" transforms to get the maximum speed out of the available CPU hardware. 

Lets break down what each of these mean:

### SIMD vectorisation ###

Optimising compilers aim to use the best possible set of CPU instructions, data pipelines and branch predictions to run code as fast as possible. Part of this involves the automatic compilation of code to use  **Single Instruction Multiple Data** instructions that broadcast an operation over multiple data elements using specialised registers. For example, 
a SIMD enabled **add** may be able to work on a 4 32 bit floats at a time using an x86 XMM register introduced with the SSE1 SIMD instruction set. 

The following C++ snippet compiled with `clang 11` using the `-O3` and `march=native` flags shows this nicely. 

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

float sum_vector() {
    std::vector<float> vec(16);
    std::iota(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 0);
    float sum = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<vec.size(); i++) {
        sum +=vec[i];
    }
    return sum;

}

```

```asm
.LCPI0_0:
        .long   0x42f00000                      # float 120
sum_vector():                        # @sum_vector()
        movss   xmm0, dword ptr [rip + .LCPI0_0] # xmm0 = mem[0],zero,zero,zero
        ret
```

However the compiler cannot see all ends and is often incapable of identifying large scale data transformations that may result in better
SIMD utilisation down the line. The MDAnalysis distance library is a good example of this, showing limited used of the XMM registers that would result in 
better performance when compiled with SSE instruction flags.

 ```c++
int i =0;
 ```

 ```assembly
%rax %edx
 ```

So what can we do to remedy this situation? There are two main possible paths that vary in difficulty.

1. We can try and help the compiler by organising the data in a manner that might help it 

2.  We can use **explicit vectorisation** where we use C++ functions that directly embed the assembly instructions we want (or very close to)
in the generated assembly. This allows us to have much more control over when and how data is transformed into
SIMD constructs.
