title: Release 2.8.0 of MDAnalysis
---

We are happy to release version 2.8.0 of MDAnalysis!

This is a minor release of the MDAnalysis library, which means that it
contains enhancements, bug fixes, deprecations, and other
backwards-compatible changes.

However, in this case *minor* does not quite do justice to what is
happening in this release, given that we have (at least) three big
changes/additions:

1. The license was changed to the **Lesser General Public License** so
   that MDAnalysis can be used by packages under *any* license while
   keeping the source code itself free and protected.
2. We introduce the [Guesser][guesser modules docs] API for
   guessing missing topology attributes such as element or mass in a
   *context-dependent* manner. Until release 3.0, you should not
   notice any differences but under the hood we are getting ready to
   make it easier to work with simulations in a different *context*
   (e.g., with the MARTINI force field) or experimental PDB
   files). With consistent attributes, such as elements, it becomes a
   lot easier to interface with tools like the cheminformatics RDKit
   (via the [converters][converter modules docs]). 
   
   The guessers are the [GSoC 2022 project][] of @aya9aladdin with
   help from @lilyminium, @IAlibay, and @jbarnoud.[^guesserPR]
3. We are introducing [parallel analysis][] for tools in
   [MDAnalysis.analysis][] following the simple
   *split-apply-combine* paradigm that we originally prototyped in
   [PMDA][] [^PMDApaper]. What's really exciting is that *any* analysis code
   that is based on [MDAnalysis.analysis.base.AnalysisBase][] can
   enable parallelization with a few lines of extra code---all the
   hard work is done behind the scenes in the base class (in a way
   that is fully backwards compatible!).

   This new feature is the work of @marinegor who brought his
   [GSoC 2023 project][] to completion, with great contributions by
   @p-j-smith, @yuxuanzhuang and @RMeli [^parallelizationPR].
   
   Not all MDAnalysis analysis classes have parallelization enabled
   yet but @talagayev has been working tirelessly on already updating
   `GNMAnalysis`, `BAT`, `Dihdedral`, `Ramachandran`, `Janin`, `DSSP`
   (yes, MDAnalysis has _finally_ got DSSP, based on [pydssp][], also
   thanks to @marinegor), `HydrogenBondAnalysis`, in addition to
   `RMSD`. 


## License change to LGPL

<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">
<img src="https://www.gnu.org/graphics/lgplv3-with-text-154x68.png"
title="LGPLv3" alt="LGPLv3 logo" style="float: right"/>
</a>

This is the first release of MDAnalysis under the **Lesser General
Public License**. We have been working towards this license change for
the last 3 years; this (almost) concludes the process that we
described in our [licensing update blog post][licensing update].


* **All code** is now under [LGPLv2.1
  license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html)
  or any higher version. 
* The package is under the [LGPLv3
  license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html) or any higher
  version. However, once we have removed dependencies that prevent
  licensing under LGPLv2.1+ at the moment, we will also license the
  package under the same **LGPLv2.1+** as the code itself.

We would like to thank all our contributors who granted us permission to
change the license. We would also like to thank a number of
institutions who were especially supportive of our open source
efforts, namely Arizona State University, Australian National
University, Johns Hopkins University, and the Open Molecular Science
Foundation. We are also grateful to NumFOCUS for legal support.

## Supported environments

The minimum required NumPy version is 1.23.3.

Supported Python versions: **3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13**. Support for version 
3.13 has been added in this release and support for 3.9 has been
dropped (following [SPEC 0][])

Supported Operating Systems:
  - **Linux** (on [x86-64][], [aarch64][])
  - **Windows** (on [x86-64][])
  - **MacOS** (on [x86-64][] and [ARM64][])


## Upgrading to MDAnalysis version 2.8.0

To update with `mamba` (or `conda`)  from the [conda-forge channel][] run

```bash
mamba update -c conda-forge mdanalysis
```

To update from [PyPi][] with `pip` run

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis
```

For more help with installation see the [installation instructions in the User Guide][]. 
Make sure you are using a Python version compatible with MDAnalysis 
before upgrading (Python >= 3.10).


## Notable changes

For a full list of changes, bugfixes and deprecations see the [CHANGELOG][].

#### Enhancements:

* Added guess_TopologyAttrs() API to the Universe to handle attribute
  guessing (PR #3753)
* Added the DefaultGuesser class, which is a general-purpose guesser with
  the same functionalities as the existing guesser.py methods (PR #3753)
* Introduce parallelization API to `AnalysisBase` and to `analysis.rms.RMSD` class
  (Issue #4158, PR #4304)
* Add `analysis.DSSP` module for protein secondary structure assignment, based on [pydssp](https://github.com/ShintaroMinami/PyDSSP)
* Improved performance of PDBWriter (Issue #2785, PR #4472)
* Added parsing of arbitrary columns of the LAMMPS dump parser. (Issue #3504)
* Implement average structures with iterative algorithm from
  DOI 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11988. (Issue #2039, PR #4524)
* Add support for TPR files produced by Gromacs 2024.1 (PR #4523)

#### Fixes:

 * Fix Bohrium (Bh) atomic mass in tables.py (PR #3753)
 * Catch higher dimensional indexing in GroupBase & ComponentBase (Issue #4647)
 * Do not raise an Error reading H5MD files with datasets like
   `observables/<particle>/<property>` (part of Issue #4598, PR #4615)
 * Fix failure in double-serialization of TextIOPicklable file reader.
   (Issue #3723, PR #3722)
 * Fix failure to preserve modification of coordinates after serialization,
   e.g. with transformations
   (Issue #4633, PR #3722)
 * Fix PSFParser error when encoutering string-like resids
   (Issue #2053, Issue #4189 PR #4582)
 * Convert openmm Quantity to raw value for KE and PE in OpenMMSimulationReader.
 * Atomname methods can handle empty groups (Issue #2879, PR #4529)
 * Fix bug in PCA preventing use of `frames=...` syntax (PR #4423)
 * Fix `analysis/diffusionmap.py` iteration through trajectory to iteration
   over `self._sliced_trajectory`, hence supporting
   `DistanceMatrix.run(frames=...)` (PR #4433)


#### Changes:

 * Relicense code contributions from GPLv2+ to LGPLv2.1+
   and the package from GPLv3+ to LGPLv3+ (PR #4794)
 * only use distopia < 0.3.0 due to API changes (Issue #4739)
 * The `fetch_mmtf` method has been removed as the REST API service
   for MMTF files has ceased to exist (Issue #4634)
 * MDAnalysis now builds against numpy 2.0 rather than the
   minimum supported numpy version (PR #4620)
