We have just released MDAnalysis version 0.16.1. This release is dedicated to 
purely fixing bugs, thank you to everyone who helped us identify these!
For full details of the bugs fixed, see the [release notes][notes].

Thank you also to our four new contributors, [Jon Kapla][jon], [Sang Young Noh][sang],
[Andrew William King][andrew] and [Kathleen Clark][kathleen].

Besides the bug fixes we updated the style
([PR 1126][doc-pr]) of our [docs][docs] so that they match with the website.
