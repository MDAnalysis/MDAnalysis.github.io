We are proud to announce that MDAnalysis — in [collaboration with Molecular Nodes, ProLIF, and WESTPA](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/GSoC-2025-Project-Ideas#collaborations) — 
is hosting _four_ [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] (GSoC) contributors: @jpkrowe, @nilay-v3rma, @PardhavMaradani, and @yuyuan871111. MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own [organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] 
for the sixth year in a row. We are grateful to Google for granting us the opportunity to get started on these four very exciting projects!
