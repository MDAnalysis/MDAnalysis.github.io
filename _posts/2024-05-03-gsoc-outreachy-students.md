title: Google Summer of Code and Outreachy Students 2024
---

We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis is hosting three [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] (GSoC) contributors - [@ljwoods2](https://github.com/ljwoods2), [@talagayev](https://github.com/talagayev) and [@lunamorrow](https://github.com/lunamorrow) - and an [Outreachy][outreachy] intern - [@adetutudeborah](https://github.com/adetutudeborah). MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own [organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] for the fifth year running, and we are excited to be hosting our second-ever [MDAnalysis Outreachy internship](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2024-05/). We are grateful to Google and Outreachy for granting us the opportunity to get started on _four_ very exciting projects!

# GSoC

## Lawson Woods: [Enhancing the Interoperability and Efficiency of the Zarrtraj MDAKit](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/BYYAE9MR)

Streaming trajectory data directly from cloud storage will allow researchers to share their trajectories more easily than ever before, however, rewriting existing trajectory file readers for cloud-streaming would be a slow and complex process. [zarrtraj](https://github.com/Becksteinlab/zarrtraj), a trajectory file format based on [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) storage, presents an alternative which natively supports AWS S3, Google Cloud Buckets, and Azure Blob Storage in addition to reading from a local directory without much added complexity. Lawson's GSoC 2024 project will be to continue enhancing the ease-of-use, robustness, and efficiency of this format.

Lawson is a computer science student at Arizona State University (ASU) graduating in December 2024. You can find Lawson on GitHub as [@ljwoods2](https://github.com/ljwoods2) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawson-woods/). To see updates on the `zarrtraj` project as well as his other projects you can check out [his blog](https://ljwoods2.github.io/).
