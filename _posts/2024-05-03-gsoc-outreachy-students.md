We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis is hosting three [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] (GSoC) contributors - [@ljwoods2](https://github.com/ljwoods2), [@talagayev](https://github.com/talagayev) and [@lunamorrow](https://github.com/lunamorrow) - and an [Outreachy][outreachy] intern - [@adetutudeborah](https://github.com/adetutudeborah). MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own [organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] for the fifth year running, and we are excited to be hosting our second-ever [MDAnalysis Outreachy internship](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2024-05/). We are grateful to Google and Outreachy for granting us the opportunity to get started on _four_ very exciting projects!
