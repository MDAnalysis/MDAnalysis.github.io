MDAnalysis will be delivering a 3 half-day remote (online) workshop hosted by [PRACE](https://prace-ri.eu/) / [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en) on the 26-28th of May 2021.

The workshop will include both lecture and practical portions. We will [cover topics](https://events.prace-ri.eu/event/1201/timetable/) including:

* The fundamentals and basics of MDAnalysis
* How to use existing analyses
* How to write your own analyses
* Parallel analysis in an HPC setting (using SURFsara supercomputing facilities)
* Advanced functionality such as universe construction and transformations

The workshop is aimed at users in academia and industry who are already familiar with Python and molecular dynamics.
We will have separate sessions at different levels, ranging from introductory to
advanced use.
MDAnalysis developers will be present to help you during practical portions of the sessions and to answer your questions about how to work productively with MDAnalysis.
We will also be holding office hours for extended tutoring -- ask us for help with
the design of your own workflows!
