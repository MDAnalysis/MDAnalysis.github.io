title: MDAKits
---

As part of our [CZI EOSS 4 grant]({% post_url 2021-08-31-CZI-EOSS4 %})
we announced the **MDAKits ecosystem**. An MDAKit contains code based
on MDAnalysis that solves a specific scientific problems or in some
form enhances the MDAnalysis core library. An MDAKit can be written by
anyone and hosted anywhere. However, we are producing **tools for
creating MDAKits** to help developers and we are working on the
**MDAKits registry** to promote MDAKits to the wider user
community. The MDAKit registry is going to be a public facing
repository that promotes MDAKits to the MDAnalysis community. The
MDAKit registry will offer regular checks and reviews in order to help
improve and maintain the listed MDAKits.

We produced a *White Paper* named **MDAKits: Supporting and promoting
the development of community packages leveraging the MDAnalysis
library [v0.1.0]**, available as a PDF at doi: XXXXXXX that provides
details. 

## Give us feedback!

We are looking for **feedback from the community**: please let us know
via XXXX what your thoughts are: 

* As a **user**: What do you like or dislike about the MDAKits
  approach? Would you want to use an MDAKit?
* As a **developer**: Would you be interested in creating an MDAKit?
  What should we do to make it easy for you?
