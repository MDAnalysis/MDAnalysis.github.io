We are happy to anounce that MDAnalysis is hosting a [GSoC][gsoc] student for
[NumFOCUS][numfocus] this year, [Utkarsh Bansal][utkarsh-blog] (@utkbansal
on GitHub), with his project ["Port to pytest"][utkarsh-gsoc].

# Utkarsh Bansal: Port unit tests to pytest

Utkarsh will port our complete unit tests
from [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing.html)
to [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). This is a massive undertaking
for MDAnalysis with over 4000 individual tests. But we have great confidence in
him and he has started work already to ensure that we don't have a drop in code
coverage during the transition. Newer projects under the MDAnalysis umbrella all
use pytests and we are happy to see the switch happening for MDAnalysis as well.
Utkarsh will [blog][utkarsh-blog] continuously during the summer to let you know
how far the transition has come and how to best write unit-tests in python.

Utkarsh is currently pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering
and will be graduating this summer. He hopes to learn new things about python
and testing in general this summer and is planning to continue his career as a
software developer.
