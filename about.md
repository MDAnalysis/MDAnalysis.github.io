## Community

**MDAnalysis** is developed and maintained as a freely available, open-source
project by a global community of scientists. The MDAnalysis community adheres
to our [Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/conduct/) and invites everyone
to [participate]({{site.baseurl}}/#participating) --- be it on the mailing
lists, through issue reports, or code contributions.

All *contributors* to the MDAnalysis library and its subprojects are acknowledged
in a file called `AUTHORS` in each source code repository and in the list of
contributions; as examples see the [`AUTHORS` file for
mdanalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/blob/develop/package/AUTHORS)
and the [contributors for
MDAnalysis/mdanalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/graphs/contributors).

MDAnalysis and the algorithms implemented in the library and the subprojects are
scientific software that are described in [academic
publications]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/citations/).

MDAnalysis is used in a variety of [other molecular dynamics tools]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/used-by/).


## Open source

All our [code]({{site.baseurl}}/#availability) and our [teaching
materials]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/learning_MDAnalysis/) are available
under open source licenses from repositories at
[https://github.com/MDAnalysis/](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/). The
MDAnalysis library itself is published under the [GNU General Public
License, version 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html); other
supporting libraries are published under the MIT or the BSD-3 clause
licence. 

Installable packages are available through the popular ``pip`` and
``conda`` package managers as well as some Linux distributions.


## Governance

Project leadership is provided by a subset of contributors, the
*MDAnalysis Core Developers*
([@MDAnalysis/coredevs](https://github.com/orgs/MDAnalysis/teams/coredevs))
who have produced substantial contributions over extended lengths of
time and who remain active in reviewing issues and discussions on the
various mailing lists and our Discord server. 

### MDAnalysis Core Developers

The **Core Developers** lead the MDAnalysis project and are responsible to
the community and to NumFOCUS, our fiscal sponsor. They **represent
the project publicly** and **vote to make decisions for the project**.

Core Developers are granted commit rights (write access) to the [GitHub source
code repositories][orgrepo] and thus can approve pull requests for merges.

The current
[@MDAnalysis/coredevs](https://github.com/orgs/MDAnalysis/teams/coredevs/members)
team ("MDAnalysis Core Developers") consists of:


- @fiona-naughton
- @hmacdope
- @IAlibay
- @jbarnoud
- @lilyminium
- @orbeckst
- @PicoCentauri
- @richardjgowers
- @tylerjereddy

### MDAnalysis Emeriti Core Developers

**Emerita/Emeritus Core Developers** are former Core Developers who remain
connected to the project but have stepped back from the day-to-day
decision making. Emeriti Core Developers can reinstate themselves to
Core Developer status.

Emeriti Core Developers maintain commit rights (write access) to the
[GitHub source code repositories][orgrepo] and can approve pull requests for
merges.

The current *Emeriti Core Developers* are:

- @dotsdl
- Elizabeth Denning
- @jandom
- @kain88-de
- @micaela-matta
- @mnmelo
- @mtiberti
- @nmichaud
- @seb-buch
- @zemanj

### Decision Making Process and Membership

1. All decisions are made by *simple majority*[^1] of the [MDAnalysis Core
   Developers](#mdanalysis-core-developers).
2. New *Core Developers* are elected with a simple majority of current
   MDAnalysis Core Developers.
3. Current Core Developers are polled annually to *opt-in* to remain
   a Core Developer; otherwise they transition to [Emerita/Emeritus
   Core Developer](#mdanalysis-emeriti-core-developers) status.

[^1]: A [simple majority][] is defined as *more than half the votes
     cast*. Abstentions or blanks are excluded in calculating a
     majority vote. Totals do not include votes cast by someone not
     entitled to vote[^2] or improper multiple votes by a single
     member.  Illegal votes[^3] are counted as votes cast;  
     if only two choices (such as a binary "yes"/"no" vote) are
     possible, a majority vote is more "yes" than "no" votes.
	 	
[^2]: See [MDAnalysis Core Developers](#mdanalysis-core-developers)
    for the list of *individuals entitled to vote*.
	
[^3]: *Illegal votes* are votes that were cast for ineligible choices.

### Code of Conduct

Everyone in the MDAnalysis community adheres to our [Code of
Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/conduct/).  A rotating subset of three
MDAnalysis Core Developers is tasked to respond to and to investigate
[Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/conduct/) violations.
