## Community

**MDAnalysis** is developed and maintained as a freely available, open-source
project by a global community of scientists. The MDAnalysis community adheres
to our [Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/conduct/) and invites everyone
to [participate]({{site.baseurl}}/#participating) --- be it on the mailing
lists, through issue reports, or code contributions.

All *contributors* to the MDAnalysis library and its subprojects are acknowledged
in a file called `AUTHORS` in each source code repository and in the list of
contributions; as examples see the [`AUTHORS` file for
mdanalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/blob/develop/package/AUTHORS)
and the [contributors for
MDAnalysis/mdanalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/graphs/contributors).

MDAnalysis and the algorithms implemented in the library and the subprojects are
scientific software that are described in [academic
publications]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/citations/).

MDAnalysis is used in a variety of [other molecular dynamics tools]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/used-by/).


## Open source

All our [code]({{site.baseurl}}/#availability) and our [teaching
materials]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/learning_MDAnalysis/) are available
under open source licenses from repositories at
[https://github.com/MDAnalysis/](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/). The
MDAnalysis library itself is published under the [GNU General Public
License, version 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html); other
supporting libraries are published under the MIT or the BSD-3 clause
licence. 

Installable packages are available through the popular ``pip`` and
``conda`` package managers as well as some Linux distributions.


## Governance

Project leadership is provided by a subset of contributors,
the *MDAnalysis Core Developers*
([@MDAnalysis/coredevs](https://github.com/orgs/MDAnalysis/teams/coredevs))
who have produced substantial contributions over extended lengths of
time and who remain active in reviewing issues and discussions on the
various mailing lists. MDAnalysis Core Developers are granted commit
rights (write access) to the GitHub source code repository.

### MDAnalysis Core Developers

The current
[@MDAnalysis/coredevs](https://github.com/orgs/MDAnalysis/teams/coredevs/members)
team ("MDAnalysis Core Developers") consists of:

- @dotsdl
- @fiona-naughton
- @IAlibay
- @jandom
- @jbarnoud
- @kain88-de
- @lilyminium
- @micaela-matta
- @mnmelo
- @mtiberti
- @orbeckst
- @richardjgowers
- @seb-buch
- @tylerjereddy
- @zemanj


### Decision Making Process

1. All decisions are made by *simple majority*[^1] of the MDAnalysis Core
   Developers.
2. New MDAnalysis Core Developers are elected with a simple majority
   of current MDAnalysis Core Developers.
   

[^1]: A [simple majority][] is defined as *more than half the votes
     cast*. Abstentions or blanks are excluded in calculating a
     majority vote. Totals do not include votes cast by someone not
     entitled to vote[^2] or improper multiple votes by a single
     member.  Illegal votes[^3] are counted as votes cast;  
     if only two choices (such as a binary "yes"/"no" vote) are
     possible, a majority vote is more "yes" than "no" votes.
	 	
[^2]: See [MDAnalysis Core Developers](#mdanalysis-core-developers)
    for the list of *individuals entitled to vote*.
	
[^3]: *Illegal votes* are votes that were cast for ineligible choices.

### Code of Conduct

Everyone in the MDAnalysis community adheres to our [Code of
Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/conduct/).  A rotating subset of three
MDAnalysis Core Developers is tasked to respond to and to investigate
[Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/conduct/) violations.
