title: About MDAnalysis
---

**MDAnalysis** is an object-oriented python toolkit to analyze
molecular dynamics trajectories generated by
[CHARMM](http://www.charmm.org/), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org
Gromacs), [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/),
[LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/), [Amber](http://ambermd.org/); it
also reads other formats
(e.g. [PDB](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=file_formats/pdb/index.html)
files and [XYZ format](http://openbabel.org/wiki/XYZ_%28format%29)
trajectories; see the **[supported coordinate
formats]({{site.pypi.docs}}/documentation_pages/coordinates/init.html#id1)**
for the full list). It can write most of these formats, too, together
with atom selections for use in [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org),
[CHARMM](http://www.charmm.org/),
[VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) and
[PyMol](http://www.pymol.org/) (see [selection
exporters]({{site.pypi.docs}}/documentation_pages/selections_modules.html#selection-exporters)
for more details).

MDAnalysis allows one to read molecular dynamics trajectories and
access the atomic coordinates through [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
arrays. This provides a flexible and relatively fast framework for
complex analysis tasks. In addition,
[CHARMM-style](http://www.charmm.org/html/documentation/c34b1/select.html)
atom [selection
commands]({{site.pypi.docs}}/documentation_pages/selections.html)
are implemented. Trajectories can also be manipulated (for instance,
fit to a reference structure) and written out.

Please report **bugs** or **enhancement requests** through the [Issue
Tracker]({{site.github.issues}}). Questions
can also be asked on the [{{site.mailinglists.discussion.name}}
mailing list]({{site.mailinglists.discussion.url}}).

# Installation Quick Start

To install the latest stable release, use
[pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html):

{% highlight bash %}
pip install MDAnalysis
{% endhighlight %}

To run the test cases and examples, also install the unit tests (about 20 MiB
in size):

{% highlight bash %}
pip install MDAnalysisTests
{% endhighlight %}


# Learning MDAnalysis

The [MDAnalysis Tutorial](http://www.mdanalysis.org/MDAnalysisTutorial/) serves
as an introduction to the library and there are other Tutorials available, too.

See the [Online Documentation]({{site.pypi.docs}})
for more information on how to use MDAnalysis and the available
documentation on the Wiki. The [paper on
MDAnalysis](#MichaudAgrawal2011) contains a high-level description of
the structure and philosophy of the library together with examples of
its use.

Finally, you can also ask for advice or help on the
[{{site.mailinglists.discussion.name}} mailing
list]({{site.mailinglists.discussion.url}}). If you find *bugs* or
want to *request enhancements* please [file a
report]({{site.github.wiki}}/ReportingProblems) in the [Issue
Tracker]({{site.github.issues}}).

# Historical, Technical and Artistic Remarks

MDAnalysis was originally inspired by the Schulten Group's
[MDTools](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools/) for Python, and the DCD
reading code is derived from VMD's
[catdcd](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools/catdcd/). MDAnalysis is GPL
licensed, except for some 3rd party code that is included under GPL-compatible
licenses; for instance the dcd reading code is under the [UIUC Open Source
Licence](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools/catdcd/license.html). See
the files AUTHORS and LICENSE in the distribution for details.

Some time-critical routines are written in C or [cython](http://cython.org) and
require a working C compiler. The minimum required version of Python is
2.6. MDAnalysis has been successfully used on Linux and Mac OS X.

The **MDAnalysis 'Atom' Logo** was designed by **Christian Beckstein** and is
