# MDAnalysis Web Site #

The home page [www.mdanalysis.org](https://www.mdanalysis.org) is maintained as
a [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) site. The home page is also
accessible as [mdanalysis.github.io](https://mdanalysis.github.io).

Pages are generated from markdown files using the static site
generator
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).

## General page authoring guide ##

- use [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- use utf-8 encoding
- The top-level heading (h1) is set by the *title:* attribute in the
  front matter of each page.
- In-text headings start at h2, i.e., `## heading title ##` in
  Markdown. There should *not be any h1 headings inside the page*.
  
For further notes see [Web development](#web-development) below.


## Blog [mdanalysis.org/blog](https://www.mdanalysis.org/blog) ##

Check out the repository, edit the pages under `_posts`, and push
commits. The published pages are on the *master* branch.

### File name 

Blog posts should be placed under `_posts`. These should have names
according to:

    YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md

where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, and `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit
numbers. 

### Meta data header of markdown files

Each post should have a header with:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: "The title of this post"
    ---

in order for it to be picked up by the paginator. You *must* put the title in
quotation marks if it contains special characters.

Other keys can be in the header (such as *date* (overrides file name date) or
*order* (for [static pages](#static-pages))).


### Section headers

* Do not put a title at the start of the post. The title from the metadata will
  create the level 1 header.
* Do not use level 1 (`# ... #`) headers, level 1 is reserved for the overall
  title.
* Use level 2 (`## ... ##`) or higher level headers.


### Good to know

The `blog` directory should not be touched, as this is only here to set the paginator.

* The `_site` directory is generated by Jekyll on the GitHub server side and
  should not be included in commits.
* You can sign posts with your
  [@mention](https://help.github.com/articles/mentions-on-github-pages/)
  and it will link to your GitHub profile.
* If the date on a post is in in the future at the time of the commit,
  it will not be built *and will not appear* (until the next commit on
  or after the time of the post).


## Web development ##

We are using the minimalist [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

### Static pages
Additional static pages go under `pages`. If they have the layout type
"page" they will be automatically included in the *sidebar*. The static
"about" page is left at the top level.

To customize the *order of pages in the sidebar*, add the attribute
`order: <INTEGER>` to the front-matter. Pages will be sorted lowest to
highest. Note that some entries in the sidebar are hardcoded in
`_includes/sidebar.html`.

If a page should *not show up in the sidebar*, use `layout:
otherpage`.




### Creating content ###

There are two ways to add and edit files:

* Check out the repository, edit the pages, and push commits. The
  published pages are on the *master* branch.
* Use the *add file*/*upload file* and *edit file* functionality in
  the https://github.com/MDAnalysis/MDAnalysis.github.io repository
  web frontend.
  

### Mark-up format: Markdown ###

The GitHub pages can either use HTML or
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as processed by
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).

The actual markdown processor is
[kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org) so it parses more than basic
markdown --- see the
[kramdown syntax](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html),
including MathJax.

### Images ###

Drop images into the `public/images` directory and include them like

```html
  <img src="{{ site.images }}/imagename.png"
   style="float: right" alt="alternative text" width="30%"/>
   ```

or use Markdown
```markdown
![alternative text]({{ site.images }}/imagename.png)
```


### Notes on using Jekyll ###

#### Absolute site links

For links between pages to work, generate absolute links with `site.baseurl`
liquid tag:

```
[see citations]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/citations)
```

The example will link to the file `/pages/citations`.

**Note**: Always put a slash `/` *after* `{{ site.baseurl }}`.

We define additional variables in `_config.yml` and use them with liquid tags.
In particular, the sidebar `_includes/sidebar.html` is configured with
additional links that are all stored in the config file.

#### Links to blog posts
Use the
[post_url](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#linking-to-posts)
liquid tag `{% post_url FILENAME_NO_SUFFIX %}`. *FILENAME_NO_SUFFIX*
is something like "2025-02-11-GSOC2024-final-blog" to reference the
file `_posts/2025-02-11-GSOC2024-final-blog.md`. Note that the `.md`
suffix is *not* included.

Prefix with the baseurl so you use it something like
```markdown
See the [GSOC 2024 blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url 2025-02-11-GSOC2024-final-blog %}) 
for more details.
```

#### Liquid tags

One does not need spaces between the configuration variable and the
curly braces (i.e.  `{{ site.baseurl }}/` as typical seen). If you
find that your editor breaks the line inside the curly braces
(which upsets Jekyll greatly) then omit the space.



### Local testing ###

To locally test that your edits look ok before pushing them, run
*Jekyll* from a docker container (always works if you can get docker
to run) or install
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) as
described in the docs (can be frustrating because of broken dependencies).


#### Using docker container for local builds ####

Running Jekyll from a docker image:

* on Linux you should be able to start/run docker after installing the
  appropriate docker package through your package manager
* on MacOS
  - install Docker Desktop
    https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/ and let it
    install all kind of startup items
  - start Docker

Follow the solution from https://stackoverflow.com/a/58850151/ as
described next:

To **build the static site**, run `jekyll build` inside docker:
```bash
export JEKYLL_VERSION=3.8
docker run --rm \
  --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
  -it jekyll/jekyll:$JEKYLL_VERSION \
  jekyll build
```
The static site files are stored in the `_site` directory.

Then you must **serve the site** so you can view them in a web browser
```bash
python -m http.server --directory _site 4444
```
(You can leave out the port number and then it defaults to 8000.)

Point your browser to http://localhost:4444

When you make changes, you need to re-build the site.

*Note that the CSS is only rendered correctly when the pages are
served. Just directly browsing the files will not show the site as it
will appear on the web.*
	

#### Build site locally ####

To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run `Jekyll`
with `Bundler`. See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) for notes on how to install Jekyll
locally.

Use the command

    bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload --future --incremental

in the root of your repository (after switching to the gh-pages branch for
project repositories), and your site should be available at
<http://localhost:4000>. 

Running Jekyll locally has the advantage that you can have it update
the site continuously while you're editing files.

(See the [serve commandline
options](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#serve-command-options)
for more details.)

For a full list of Jekyll commands, see the [Jekyll
documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).




##### Updating the github-pages plugin #####

If you try out new functionality or plugins locally and you get error
messages then try to
[update the github-pages plugin](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#keeping-your-site-up-to-date-with-the-github-pages-gem)
with

    bundle update github-pages

##### Problems with jekyll and required packages? #####

* See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) and if in doubt, follow the latest instructions from
  [GitHub: Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with
  Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
  and in particular [Jekyll's installation
  instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

* **Problems with installing jekyll/github-pages?** If the standard
  installation for jekyll does not work for you (many people complain,
  for instance, *commonmarker* does not install
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58849651/bundler-cannot-install-commonmarker)
  try a **docker container**, as described above.

* In case the you get an error that a **javascript environment is
  missing**, install a javascript environment like `nodejs` from your
  distribution repositories.
