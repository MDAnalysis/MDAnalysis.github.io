**MDAnalysis** is an object-oriented Python library to analyze
trajectories from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in [many popular
formats]({{site.pypi.docs}}/documentation_pages/coordinates/init.html#id1). It
can write most of these formats, too, together with [atom
selections]({{site.pypi.docs}}/documentation_pages/selections_modules.html#selection-exporters)
suitable for visualization or native analysis tools.

MDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories (including
individual coordinate frames such as biomolecules in the PDB format)
and access the atomic coordinates through
[NumPy](https://numpy.scipy.org/) arrays. This provides a flexible and
relatively fast framework for complex analysis tasks. In addition,
powerful atom
[selection commands]({{site.pypi.docs}}/documentation_pages/selections.html)
are implemented. Trajectories can also be manipulated (for instance,
fit to a reference structure) and written out. The
[basic example]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/basic_example) demonstrates some
of these features.
