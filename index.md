 The **MDAnalysis Project** develops open-source tools for the analysis of molecular simulation data, providing researchers with efficient and accessible solutions for studying molecular structures and dynamics.

 MDAnalysis is a fiscally sponsored project of [NumFOCUS][], a nonprofit that promotes open practices in research, data, and scientific computing.
 
At the core of the project is *MDAnalysis*, **an open-source Python library** for analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories across [multiple formats]({{ site.docs.userguide.url }}/formats/index.html#formats). *MDAnalysis* enables seamless reading and writing of simulation data, allowing users to efficiently analyze molecular structures and dynamics, including particle-based trajectories and individual coordinate frames (e.g., biomolecules in the [PDB format][]).

With *MDAnalysis*, you can access atomic coordinates as [NumPy][] arrays, providing a flexible and efficient framework for complex analysis tasks. The library includes powerful [atom selection commands]({{ site.docs.userguide.url }}/selections.html) for extracting subsets of structures and supports trajectory transformations (e.g., fitting to a reference structure).

Learn more about our **mission, development, team, and governance** on the [About MDAnalysis]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/) page.
