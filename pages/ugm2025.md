## What to Expect
The UGM will bring together users of the MDAnalysis package from different communities.

## Travel and Accommodation

*Participants are expected to make their own travel and accommodation arrangements.*

[Tempe][] is part of the "Valley of the Sun" metropolitan area, which encompasses
[Phoenix][], the 5th most populous city in the US. Today the area is home to more
than 4.8 million people and encompasses the ancient lands of the Akimel O'odham
(Pima), Maricopa, and Tohono O'odham tribes.

### Airport

**Phoenix Sky Harbor** [PHX][] airport has direct connections to all major hubs
in the US.

PHX airport is 5.5 miles (10 minutes by car/rideshare) from the workshop venue

### Public transport (Light Rail)

The [Valley Metro Light Rail][Light Rail] connects the airport to Tempe along a
West-East axis. If your destination is near a Light Rail stop then
public transport works well:

1. Take the free [PHX Sky Train][] from the terminal to the **44th St/Washington**
Metro Rail stop.
2. Walk from the Sky Train stop to the Light Rail stop (all inside the 44th St
Sky Train structure)
3. Buy a ticket at the ticket machine near the exit escalators to the Light
Rail stop.
4. At the [44th St/Washington stop][LightRail44thSt] (Stop #10018) take the
*east-bound* Light Rail (direction Mesa, Gilbert Rd/Main St).
5. The stop closest to the Hyatt Place Hotel and the workshop venue is
**University Dr/Rural Rd** (Stop #10023). If you want to get off closer to
downtown Tempe get off one stop earlier at **Veterans Way/College Ave** (Stop #10025)
6. Walk to your destination.

### Car/rideshare

To get from the airport to anywhere in Tempe either take a cab (traditional or self-driving
Waymo) or rideshare (Lyft, Uber).

### ASU Venue

The workshop will be held in the Student Success Center in the Department of
Physics at [Arizona State University][ASU] (room PSF 186 in the [Physical Sciences F
building][PSF]). The address is

  Department of Physics  
  Arizona State University  
  Physical Sciences F Building  
  550 E Tyler Mall, PSF 186  
  Tempe, AZ 85287  
  USA
 
Paid parking is available in the [Tyler Street Parking
Structure][TylerStParking] and other on-campus parking structures.
