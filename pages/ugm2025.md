## What to Expect
The UGM will bring together users of the MDAnalysis package from different communities. Our goal is to foster an opportunity to connect interdisciplinary researchers and developers across biomolecular simulations, soft matter, materials science, and more. Whether you are a new MDAnalysis contributor, an MDAnalysis developer, or a researcher using (or interested in using) MDAnalysis for your work in academia or industry, this UGM is for you.

You can expect:
* Keynote talks from experts in the molecular dynamics simulations space (see [Keynote Speakers](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2025/#keynote-speakers) below)
* Talks about the science that is done with the help of MDAnalysis (see [Program](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2025/#program) below)
* A focus on using MDAnalysis for directly streaming simulation trajectories 
* Interactive tutorials diving into new features
* Short "master classes" on how to use advanced features of MDAnalysis effectively
* Direct access to the [MDAnalysis core developer team]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/governance/#mdanalysis-core-developers) to help shape future development of MDAnalysis
* Networking opportunities to foster new collaborations

## Registration

~~Register by **July 15, 2025**~~ The registration deadline is extended to **July 31, 2025** (midnight anywhere on Earth):

<a href="https://forms.gle/bPvVTMpzBkyCRtNA7" target="_blank" style="background:#FF9200;padding:10px;margin:10px 0px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px">Register</a>

### Dr. Lillian Chong

Lillian Chong is a Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Her research focuses on developing and applying
advanced simulation methods to investigate rare but biologically important events, with an emphasis on capturing rigorous kinetics. Her group
leads the development of the open-source [WESTPA][] software, which implements weighted ensemble path sampling strategies for efficient simulations
of rare events. She also works on the development of implicitly polarized force fields and rational design of protein conformational switches.
Prof. Chong received a B.S. in Chemistry at MIT and a Ph.D. in Biophysics from UCSF, under the mentorship of Peter Kollman. She then completed
postdoctoral training with Vijay Pande at Stanford University and Bill Swope at the IBM Almaden Research Center. Her honors include the Gordon
Bell Special Prize for COVID-19 Research and an NSF CAREER Award.

### Dr. Matthias Heyden

style="float: left; width: 220px; height: 220px; border-radius: 20px; border: 15px solid white" />

Matthias Heyden joined Arizona State University's School of Molecular Sciences in 2017. Prior appointments include a research group leader
position at the Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung and the Cluster of Excellence RESOLV, and as a postdoctoral researcher at the University
of California, Irvine. 

His group uses computer simulations to gain atomistic insights into molecular systems. A main focus of this work is to understand the process of
solvation of small solutes (ions, alcohols and metabolites) up to large biopolymers (proteins and nucleic acids). Another avenue of his research
is in the analysis of correlated vibrational motion in biomolecular liquids, which provide rich information on the propagation of energy and local
density fluctuations within the system (i.e. sound propagation). These simulations can be compared to coherent scattering experiments with neutrons
or x-rays, but the computer models allow further to isolate the correlations between specific components of the system and to follow time- and space
correlations of atomic vibrations with spatial resolution. This provides entirely new insights into the dynamic coupling of low-frequency intermolecular
vibrations in liquids and between biomolecules and their surrounding solvent. In addition, the Heyden lab develops novel methods to simulate biomolecular
solutions on a large scale including 100s to 1000s of flexible proteins or polymers. These approaches provide insights into the complex interactions
between biomolecules in realistic, crowded environments resembling the interior of living cells.

## Program

A finalized agenda will be available closer to the event date. The UGM will include a mix of invited and contributed talks -- including 15 minute talks,
5 minute lighting talks, and poster presentations -- as well as interactive tutorials. A streaming focused workshop will provide attendees an opportunity
to incorporate this new feature into their workflows.

Please find below the preliminary program. Please note that specific time slots and session details are subject to change.

## Travel and Accommodation

*Participants are expected to make their own travel and accommodation arrangements.*

[Tempe][] is part of the "Valley of the Sun" metropolitan area, which encompasses
[Phoenix][], the 5th most populous city in the US. Today the area is home to more
than 4.8 million people and encompasses the ancient lands of the Akimel O'odham
(Pima), Maricopa, and Tohono O'odham tribes.

### Airport

**Phoenix Sky Harbor** [PHX][] airport has direct connections to all major hubs
in the US.

PHX airport is 5.5 miles (10 minutes by car/rideshare) from the workshop venue.

### Public transport (Light Rail)

The [Valley Metro Light Rail][Light Rail] connects the airport to Tempe along a
West-East axis. If your destination is near a Light Rail stop then
public transport works well:

1. Take the free [PHX Sky Train][] from the terminal to the **44th St/Washington**
Metro Rail stop.
2. Walk from the Sky Train stop to the Light Rail stop (all inside the 44th St
Sky Train structure).
3. Buy a ticket at the ticket machine near the exit escalators to the Light
Rail stop.
4. At the [44th St/Washington stop][LightRail44thSt] (Stop #10018) take the
*east-bound* Light Rail (direction Mesa, Gilbert Rd/Main St).
5. The stop closest to the Hyatt Place Hotel and the workshop venue is
**University Dr/Rural Rd** (Stop #10023). If you want to get off closer to
downtown Tempe get off one stop earlier at **Veterans Way/College Ave** (Stop #10025).
6. Walk to your destination.

### Car/rideshare

To get from the airport to anywhere in Tempe either take a cab (traditional or self-driving
Waymo) or rideshare (Lyft, Uber).

### ASU Venue

The workshop will be held in the Student Success Center in the Department of
Physics at [Arizona State University][ASU] (room PSF 186 in the Physical Sciences F
building) and room PSH 350 in the Physical Sciences H building. The address is:

  Department of Physics  
  Arizona State University  
  Physical Sciences F Building  
  550 E Tyler Mall, PSF 186  
  Tempe, AZ 85287  
  USA
 
Paid parking is available in the [Tyler Street Parking
Structure][TylerStParking] and other on-campus parking structures.

## Support for international travel
Attendees requiring a letter clarifying the purpose of travel should [contact the MDAnalysis project manager][email]. 

## Meals
We will provide breakfast and lunch during the event. More information on local food options and group outings will be added soon!

## Health and Safety
We are committed to providing a safe, comfortable, and healthy environment for the MDAnalysis UGM and have looked to local and international entities and other organizations in the open source community to develop onsite safety measures for UGM attendees.
