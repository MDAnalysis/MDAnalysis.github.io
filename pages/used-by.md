While our documentation is mostly focused on using MDAnalysis for exploratory
analysis it is equally well suited to build your own analysis library on top of
it. Below is a list of all projects we know about that use MDAnalysis.

## Visualization tools

- [nglview](https://github.com/arose/nglview): nglview is a tool to visualize
   trajectories in jupyter notebooks.
- [mda-pymol](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/lorenz.lab/wp/index.php/2019/04/17/mda-pymol/):
   MDAnalysis has been embedded into PyMOL to read many different MD formats
   directly

## Analysis tools

-  [pydiffusion](https://github.com/bio-phys/pydiffusion): Analyze the
   rotational diffusion of your molecules.
-  [pytim](https://marcello-sega.github.io/pytim/): Pytim is a package based on
   MDAnalysis for the identification and analysis of surface molecules in
   configuration files or in trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations.
-  [pycontact](https://github.com/maxscheurer/pycontact): Analysis of
   non-covalent interactions in MD trajectories.
-  [RotamerConvolveMD](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/RotamerConvolveMD):
   Analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories or conformational ensembles in
   terms of spin-label distances as probed in double electron-electron resonance
   (DEER) experiments.
-  [PBxplore](https://github.com/pierrepo/PBxplore): PBxplore is a suite of
   tools dedicated to Protein Block (PB) analysis.
-  [cgheliparm](https://github.com/ifaust83/cgheliparm): Scripts used to analyze
   dsDNA structures from Martini MD simulations.
-  [accelerated_sampling_with_autoencoder](https://github.com/weiHelloWorld/accelerated_sampling_with_autoencoder):
   This is the framework for running accelerated sampling with data-augmented
   autoencoders.
-  [BioEn](https://github.com/bio-phys/BioEn): BioEn integrates a broad range of experimental data to refine ensembles of structures.
-  [kugupu](https://github.com/kugupu/kugupu): A molecular network generator to study charge transport pathways in amorphous materials
-  [PyInteraph](https://github.com/ELELAB/pyinteraph): A software tool
   for the analysis of structural communication in protein ensembles,
   including a PyMOL plugin and an InteractionPlotter.

## Distributions

MDAnalysis is also included in [NMRBox](https://nmrbox.org/) a distribution of
common software to analyze NMR measurements.
