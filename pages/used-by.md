While our documentation is mostly focused on using MDAnalysis for
exploratory analysis it is equally well suited to build your own
analysis library on top of it. Below is a list of projects we know
about that use MDAnalysis.


*If you know of other tools that use MDAnalysis please share
them with us on [Twitter]({{ site.twitter.url }}) or on our
[mailinglist]({{ site.mailinglists.discussion.url }}) so that we
can include them here.*


## Visualization tools

- [nglview](https://github.com/arose/nglview): nglview is a tool to visualize
   trajectories in jupyter notebooks.
- [MDSrv](https://github.com/nglviewer/mdsrv) streams and visualizes MD trajectories interactively within web browsers
- [mda-pymol](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/lorenz.lab/wp/?p=1768):
   MDAnalysis has been embedded into PyMOL to read many different MD formats
   directly (see
   [bieniekmateusz/pymol-mdanalysis](https://github.com/bieniekmateusz/pymol-mdanalysis)
   on GitHub)

## Analysis tools

-  [pydiffusion](https://github.com/bio-phys/pydiffusion): Analyze the
   rotational diffusion of your molecules.
-  [pytim](https://marcello-sega.github.io/pytim/): Pytim is a package based on
   MDAnalysis for the identification and analysis of surface molecules in
   configuration files or in trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations.
-  [pycontact](https://github.com/maxscheurer/pycontact): Analysis of
   non-covalent interactions in MD trajectories.
-  [RotamerConvolveMD](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/RotamerConvolveMD):
   Analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories or conformational ensembles in
   terms of spin-label distances as probed in double electron-electron resonance
   (DEER) experiments.
-  [PBxplore](https://github.com/pierrepo/PBxplore): PBxplore is a suite of
   tools dedicated to Protein Block (PB) analysis.
-  [cgheliparm](https://github.com/ifaust83/cgheliparm): Scripts used to analyze
   dsDNA structures from Martini MD simulations.
-  [accelerated_sampling_with_autoencoder](https://github.com/weiHelloWorld/accelerated_sampling_with_autoencoder):
   This is the framework for running accelerated sampling with data-augmented
   autoencoders.
-  [BioEn](https://github.com/bio-phys/BioEn): BioEn integrates a broad range of experimental data to refine ensembles of structures.
-  [kugupu](https://github.com/kugupu/kugupu): A molecular network generator to study charge transport pathways in amorphous materials
-  [PyInteraph](https://github.com/ELELAB/pyinteraph): A software tool
   for the analysis of structural communication in protein ensembles,
   including a PyMOL plugin and an InteractionPlotter.
-  [MAICoS](https://gitlab.com/netzlab/maicos): Analyze molecular dynamics simulations of 
   interfacial and confined systems.
-  [taurenmd](https://taurenmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A command-line interface for analysis of Molecular Dynamics simulations.

## Simulation packages
- [ESPResSo](http://espressomd.org/) is a software package for
  performing and analyzing Molecular Dynamics many-particle
  simulations of coarse-grained atomistic or bead-spring models as
  they are used in soft matter research in physics, chemistry and
  molecular biology.

## Distributions

MDAnalysis is included in [NMRBox](https://nmrbox.org/) a distribution of
common software to analyze NMR measurements. 

Some generic distributions such as [MacPorts:
py-MDAnalysis](https://ports.macports.org/port/py-MDAnalysis/summary)
(macOS), [Fedora:
python-MDAnalysis](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-MDAnalysis/)
and [archlinux:
python-mdanalysis](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-mdanalysis/)
(Linux) maintain packages of MDAnalysis.
