## When, Where, and How
Wednesday, September 27th, 2023 12 pm WEST - Friday, September 29th, 2023 3 pm WEST

[Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon][uniL] Auditorium, Building C1, Campo Grande, 1749-016 Lisbon, PT

Live, in-person format

## What to Expect
The UGM will bring together users of the MDAnalysis from different communities. Our goal is to foster an opportunity to connect for interdisciplinary researchers and developers across biomolecular simulations, soft matter, biophysics and more. Whether you are a new MDAnalysis contributor, an MDAnalysis core developer, or a researcher using (or interested in using) MDAnalysis for your work in academia or industry, this UGM is for you. You can expect:
* Keynote talks from experts in the molecular dynamics simulations space (see [Keynote Speakers](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2023/#keynote-speakers) below)
* Talks related to developing and using MDAnalysis for diverse scientific applications
* Tutorials diving into new features
* Direct access to the MDAnalysis core developer team to help shape future development of MDAnalysis
* Networking opportunities to foster new collaborations
* Hackathon and other social outings

## Keynote Speakers
### Prof. Giovanni M. Pavan

Giovanni Pavan received his MSc (2006) and PhD (2010) from the University of Trieste (Italy). From 2010-2018 he conducted research at SUPSI, first as a postdoc, then as a tenured researcher and senior researcher. Since May 2019 he is Full Professor and Head of the CPC lab at POLITO (Italy), with a double affiliation with SUPSI (Switzerland) as Professor and Head of the CMS Laboratory. His group performs research at the interface between the physics of self-assembling systems, computational supramolecular chemistry, and theoretical materials science. He is particularly interested in the dynamics of self-organizing systems, in the factors controlling it, and in how collective properties emerge in complex molecular systems. He has received various recognitions, including an ERC Consolidator and various Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) grants. He also serves as a member of the Editorial board of ChemSystemsChem (Wiley). He was recently elected as next Chair of the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in Self-Assembly and Supramolecular Chemistry (2027).
