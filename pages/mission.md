The MDAnalysis community is interested in all facets of **working
with data in the computational molecular sciences**. We welcome everyone. **We all follow our
[Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/conduct/) and strive to create an environment that is welcoming to all.** Our primary purpose is to produce software that scientists in academia and industry will trust to use in their research.

We develop and maintain projects related to the broader goal of processing and
analyzing data in the computational molecular sciences. We aim to empower users/developers to
work with our packages following [FAIR principles][]. Our central package is the
[MDAnalysis library]({{ site.github.repo }}) for the analysis of computer simulations of many-body
systems at the molecular scale. 

We believe that scientific software should be open to all while using best
practices to maintain high standards of correctness and reproducibility. We
emphasize educating our users to make best use of the tools that we produce, to
enable them to become contributors to our community and code bases.
