title: MDAnalysis team
---

MDAnalysis is a community-driven project that is made possible through the efforts of many members who contribute in numerous and diverse ways, ranging from direct package development, maintenance, documentation, communication, and managerial responsibilities. On this page we list identified project roles, current leads and supporting team members for each of those roles, and those historically responsible for the tasks. We note that the listed roles on this page can differ significantly in scope and required effort.

## Roles

In this section we list contributors who have led or contributed substantial effort to the roles listed below.
At present, we have only listed leading figures from the past 2-3 years, i.e. from 2020 onwards.
However, we hope to eventually acknowledge everyone who has been responsible for a particular role throughout
the lifetime of the project.

If you have participated to MDAnalysis in the past and your name is missing or you feel your previous/historical role could be better characterised,
please contact us at mdanalysis@numfocus.org to let us know. We also invite community members to reach out to mdanalysis@numfocus.org or the current team members if they are interested in filling missing roles or joining an existing team!

Names are listed in *alphabetical* order, and people responsible for leading a role have their names **bolded**.
