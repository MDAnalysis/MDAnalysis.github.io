title: MDAnalysis team
---

MDAnalysis is a community-driven project that is made possible through the efforts of many members who contribute in numerous and diverse ways, ranging from direct package development, maintenance, documentation, communication, and managerial responsibilities. On this page we list identified project roles, current leads and supporting team members for each of those roles, and those historically responsible for the tasks. We note that the listed roles on this page can differ significantly in scope and required effort.

## Roles

In this section we list major contributors who are leading or contributing substantial effort to the roles listed below. In addition, we list past leading figures from 2020 onwards in the "Historical contributors" column. As this team organisation structure was started in November 2023, many people contributed to these tasks before then and may not appear in this table, in particular the [emeritus core developers]({{ site.url }}/about/#mdanalysis-emeriti-core-developers).
However, we hope to eventually acknowledge everyone who has been responsible for a particular role throughout the lifetime of the project.

If you have participated to MDAnalysis in the past and your name is missing or you feel your previous/historical role could be better characterised,
please contact us at mdanalysis@numfocus.org to let us know. We also invite community members to reach out to mdanalysis@numfocus.org or the current team members if they are interested in filling missing roles or joining an existing team!

Names are listed in *alphabetical* order, and people responsible for leading a role have their names **bolded**.
