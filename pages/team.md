MDAnalysis is a community-driven project that is made possible through the efforts of many members who contribute in numerous and diverse ways, ranging from direct package development, maintenance, documentation, communication, and managerial responsibilities. On this page we list identified project roles and team members for each of those roles. We note that the listed roles on this page can differ significantly in scope and required effort.

We also invite community members to reach out to [mdanalysis@numfocus.org](mailto:mdanalysis@numfocus.org) or the current team members (whose GitHub profiles are linked in the [Roles](#roles) section) if they are interested in filling missing roles, joining an existing team, or making any other inquiries about MDAnalysis community efforts.

## Roles

In this section we list major contributors who are currently contributing substantial effort to the roles listed below.

Names are listed in *alphabetical* order.
