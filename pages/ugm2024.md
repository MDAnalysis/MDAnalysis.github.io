The UGM (User Group Meeting) will be held in-person across 3 days, August 21-23, 2024, in London, UK at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/visit/bush-house), in partnership with the [Thomas Young Centre](https://thomasyoungcentre.org/).

### Address
[Lecture Theatre 1](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/kingsvenues/rooms/bh-lt1), Bush House  
Strand Campus, King's College London  
30 Aldwych  
London, WC2B 4BG  
United Kingdom

## What to Expect
The UGM will bring together users of the MDAnalysis package from different communities. Our goal is to foster an opportunity to connect for interdisciplinary researchers and developers across biomolecular simulations, soft matter, materials science and more. Whether you are a new MDAnalysis contributor, an MDAnalysis core developer, or a researcher using (or interested in using) MDAnalysis for your work in academia or industry, this UGM is for you. You can expect:
* Keynote talks from experts in the molecular dynamics simulations space (see [Keynote Speakers](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2024/#keynote-speakers) below)
* Talks related to developing and using MDAnalysis for diverse scientific applications (see [Program](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2024/#program) below)
* Tutorials diving into new features
* Direct access to the [MDAnalysis core developer team][coredev] to help shape future development of MDAnalysis
* Networking opportunities to foster new collaborations
* Hackathon and other social outings

## Registration
The registration period is now open (see the registration button below). Attendance is free and first-come, first-serve.

Antonia has worked on Markov State models with Frank Noe and alchemical free energy calculations with Julien Michel before starting her own research group in 2020 at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Chemistry. Her group works on computational biophysics problems using machine learning and simulations to understand protein function. She is an advocate for open-source software and diamond open access publishing models. She has contributed to pyEmma, BioSimSpace and she and her group ([https://mey-research.org](https://mey-research.org)) are avid users of MDAnalysis. 

### Dr. Francesca Stanzione

Francesca is a computational chemist with over a decade expertise in target assessment, hit identification and lead optimisation. After obtaining a Ph.D. in Biotechnology, Francesca embarked on a distinguished career path. With five years of postdoctoral fellowships Francesca’s work centered on characterising the structural and dynamical properties of complex biological systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes, biological membranes and biomaterials. In 2023, Francesca joined Nxera Pharma (formerly Sosei Heptares), a renowned player in the pharmaceutical industry, where she now provides invaluable computational support to a variety of drug discovery campaigns. Prior to her role at Nxera Pharma, Francesca was at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC), working closely with software developers to help the development and enhancement of computational tools for drug discovery. Francesca's multifaceted background as a pharmaceutical chemist and her extensive experience across academia and industry positions her as a dynamic and influential figure in the realm of computational drug discovery.

## Program
The conference will start at 9:00 am on Wednesday, 21 August and will close around 5:30 pm on Thursday, 22 August. An informal hackathon will be held from 9:00 am - 4:30 pm on Friday, 23 August.

There are also many other hotel options accessible by foot or public transportation.

Most places in London are easily accessible by public [buses](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/buses/) and the [underground/rail/tram](https://tfl.gov.uk/tube-dlr-overground/status/) systems. It is cheapest to pay for transportation using contactless and Oyster cards; read more about [transportation fares here](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/).

Citizens of several countries may travel to the United Kingdom to attend a meeting without obtaining a visa. Please visit the [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/tourist-short-stay-visas) website for more information about travel visas. Attendees requiring a letter clarifying the purpose of travel should [contact the MDAnalysis project manager][email].
