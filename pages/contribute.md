MDAnalysis is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from the community. Whether you're a developer, documentation writer, or interested in improving the website, there are many ways to get involved.

You can contribute by **developing new features, fixing bugs, improving documentation, enhancing tutorials, or engaging in discussions**. If you're new, you can start by participating in community conversations and mentoring programs. For more information on how you can participate, check out the [Community]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/community/) and [Events]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/events/) pages.

This page provides an overview of how you can contribute to the [Code](#contributing-to-the-code) or [Documentation](#contributing-to-documentation).

MDAnalysis maintains **three GitHub repositories**, each dedicated to a specific area of contribution:

- [Main Code Repository]({{ site.github.repo }}): for code development and API documentation.
- [User Guide Repository]({{ site.docs.userguide.repo }}): containing installation instructions, tutorials and learning resources.
- [Website Repository][]: Hosts the website and blog.

## Contributing to the Code

If you're interested in developing new features, fixing bugs, or improving performance, contributing to the MDAnalysis codebase is a great way to get involved.

To get started:
- Read the [Contributing to the Main Codebase]({{ site.docs.userguide.url }}/stable/contributing_code.html#working-with-mdanalysis-code) guide, which outlines all the necessary steps.
- Browse [GitHub Issues]({{ site.github.issues }}) to find open tasks (look for "good first issue" if you're a beginner). You can also report bugs or suggest improvements there.
- Follow best practices, including [writing and running tests]({{ site.docs.userguide.url }}/stable/testing.html#testing) and [updating the documentation]({{ site.docs.userguide.url }}/stable/contributing_code.html#building-code-documentation) for any changes.

## Contributing to Documentation

Good documentation is essential to making MDAnalysis accessible to users and developers. MDAnalysis maintains two types of documentation: the [User Guide]({{ site.docs.userguide.url }}) and the [API Reference]({{ site.docs.mdanalysis.url }}/stable/index.html).

### User Guide

The [User Guide]({{ site.docs.userguide.url }}/stable/index.html) provides tutorials and explanatory content to help users install and learn MDAnalysis. You can contribute by updating unclear explanations or adding new tutorials or examples. 

To get started:
- Follow the [Contributing to the User Guide]({{ site.docs.userguide.url }}/stable/contributing_docs.html).
- Check for open documentation-related issues in the [User Guide GitHub Issues]({{ site.docs.userguide.issues }}).

### API Reference

The [API reference]({{ site.docs.mdanalysis.url }}/stable/index.html) is **automatically generated** from *docstrings* in the codebase and serves as a reference for developers. You can contribute by improving *docstrings* for functions, classes, and modules or updating outdated documentation.

To get started:
- Follow the [API Documentation Contribution Guide]({{ site.docs.userguide.url }}/stable/contributing_code.html#working-with-mdanalysis-docs).
- Browse open API documentation issues in [GitHub Issues]({{ site.github.issues }}).

## Other Contributions

If you are interested in contributing in other ways, such as improving the website or blog, you can refer to the [README file][] in the [Website Repository][]. While the website is already maintained by the MDAnalysis team, minor fixes and updates are always welcome.
