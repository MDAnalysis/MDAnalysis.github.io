Project leadership is provided by a group of contributors, known as the
*MDAnalysis Core Developers* ([@MDAnalysis/coredevs][]) who have produced substantial contributions over an extended period and who actively review issues and participate in discussions on GitHub Discussions and Discord. 

## MDAnalysis Core Developers

The **Core Developers** lead the MDAnalysis project and are responsible to
the community and to [NumFOCUS][], our fiscal sponsor. They **represent
the project publicly** and **vote to make decisions for the project**.

Principal Investigators (PIs) on a grant submitted by MDAnalysis via [NumFOCUS][] must be Core Developers while co-PIs do not have to be Core Developers.

Core Developers are granted commit rights (write access) to the [GitHub source
code repositories][orgrepo] and thus can approve pull requests for merges.

The current [@MDAnalysis/coredevs][] team ("MDAnalysis Core Developers") consists of:

- @BradyAJohnston
- @fiona-naughton
- @hmacdope
- @IAlibay
- @jennaswa
- @lilyminium
- @marinegor
- @micaela-matta
- @orbeckst
- @p-j-smith
- @richardjgowers
- @RMeli
- @tylerjereddy
- @yuxuanzhuang

### MDAnalysis Emeriti Core Developers

**Emerita/Emeritus Core Developers** are former Core Developers who remain
connected to the project but have stepped back from the day-to-day
decision making. Emeriti Core Developers can reinstate themselves to
Core Developer status.

Emeriti Core Developers maintain commit rights (write access) to the
[GitHub source code repositories][orgrepo] and can approve pull requests for
merges.

The current *Emeriti Core Developers* are:

- @dotsdl
- Elizabeth Denning
- @jandom
- @jbarnoud
- @kain88-de
- @mnmelo
- @mtiberti
- @nmichaud
- @PicoCentauri
- @seb-buch
- @zemanj

### Decision Making Process and Membership

1. All decisions are made by *simple majority*[^1] of the [MDAnalysis Core
   Developers](#mdanalysis-core-developers).
2. New *Core Developers* are elected with a simple majority of current
   MDAnalysis Core Developers.
3. Current Core Developers are polled annually to *opt-in* to remain
   a Core Developer; otherwise, they transition to [Emerita/Emeritus
   Core Developer](#mdanalysis-emeriti-core-developers) status.

[^1]: A [simple majority][] is defined as *more than half the votes
     cast*. Abstentions or blanks are excluded in calculating a
     majority vote. Totals do not include votes cast by someone not
     entitled to vote[^2] or improper multiple votes by a single
     member.  Illegal votes[^3] are counted as votes cast;  
     if only two choices (such as a binary "yes"/"no" vote) are
     possible, a majority vote is more "yes" than "no" votes.
        
[^2]: See [MDAnalysis Core Developers](#mdanalysis-core-developers)
    for the list of *individuals entitled to vote*.
    
[^3]: *Illegal votes* are votes that were cast for ineligible choices.
