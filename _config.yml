long_description: |
                  MDAnalysis is a Python library which enables the handling and
                  analysis of data from computer simulations of many-body
                  systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from
                  interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials. It is
                  widely used in the scientific community and is written by
                  scientists for scientists.
